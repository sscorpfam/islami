			"tafsir": "Allah opened surahh al-An'am by giving instructions to humans that all praise is only for Allah, the Creator of the heavens, the earth and everything in it, and explaining to humans that there is a path of darkness, that is the path followed by people who go astray, such as considering creatures God's creatures as gods. Allah also shows the bright path and the true light, which is to unite Allah and avoid attitudes and assumptions that lead to shirk, namely associating partners with Allah with His creatures. But those who disbelieve in Allah prefer to choose the wrong path, which leads to shirk and darkness. Allah praised him with \"Alhamdulillah\". Thus the servants know how they should praise God, namely by saying the phrase \"Alhamdulillah\". All praise is for Allah, because He is the most entitled to receive that praise, who has all the praiseworthy qualities, and all the qualities of perfection. Allah explains about Himself as the Most Praised Substance by explaining that Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, darkness and light. The creation of the heavens and the earth is specifically mentioned in this verse to show its privilege as God's great creation, which is always witnessed by mankind. In both there are lessons for humans, all of which are signs of God's perfection. The creation of darkness and light referred to in this verse is the creation of various darknesses and bright lights that are visible to the senses. Both are beneficial to God's servants. Some of the salaf scholars are of the opinion that what is meant by dhulmah (darkness) in this verse is disbelief, and what is meant by nur (light) is faith; so they explain the meaning of these verses as follows: Allah created the heavens and the earth and then He showed evidence to know Him and confirm Him. Allah warns the way of misguidance and shows the straight path by sending down His Shari'a and His books, even so the disbelievers act far from common sense, and they always choose the wrong path. Therefore Allah says at the end of this verse which means, \"But those who disbelieve associate (something) with God.\" In this verse Allah uses dhulumat (darkness) in the plural of dhulmah (darkness). While the word nur (bright) is used in the singular form. What is meant by the difference in form is that there are many kinds of error (darkness) while the guidance (light) is only one. Truth is only one, while falsehood is multiplied. At the end of this verse, it is emphasized that the disbelievers took the opposite stance. They do not specialize in praise and worship to Allah as the Creator of the heavens and the earth and the One who creates darkness and light, but they equate Allah with others in worship and praise. Yet they realize, only God is most deserving of worship and praise. Besides surahh al-An'am, there are four more surahhs that begin with al-hamdulillah, meaning all praise be to Allah, namely the first surahh al-Fatihah, the 18th surah al-Kahf, the 34th chapter of Saba', and the 35th Fathir. Apart from giving instructions on how to praise God the right way, we are also given instructions on how to behave and behave well, that is, only God deserves praise, because no matter how little or some goodness we can be proud of, it's all from God. Allah is the Most Perfect and bestows some of His goodness on creatures He wills, especially humans. Allah really glorifies this creature as mentioned in surahh al-Isra'\/17 verse 70: And indeed, We have glorified the offspring of Adam, and We carried them on land and at sea, and We gave them sustenance from the good and We have preferred them above the many creatures that We have created with perfect advantages. (al-Isra'\/17: 70) The heavens, the earth and everything in them, including human beings, did not happen by themselves, but were created by Allah Almighty, with perfect rules and regulations so that no creature can deviate from the rules and regulations. God. If that being happens by itself or of their own will and desire, things are bound to get messy, because all want to be the best or better than the others, and no one wants to be ugly, weak or beaten by the others. However, it turns out that all this happened because all creatures are subject to the rules and regulations of Allah, the Almighty, but also the Most Wise, Most Compassionate and Most Merciful. Allah creates and provides for humans adz-dzulumat, namely various darkness, dark paths, dark atmosphere, dark life and so on. Allah also creates and provides for humans an-nur, namely bright light, bright path, bright life and thoughts, transparent attitude and behavior. So it's up to humans to choose which one. In this verse it is explained that many people who deny, disbelieve and do not have strong faith choose zulumat which deviate from nature and human conscience."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah goes into more detail in His creation of creatures that have a lot of power in their lives on this earth, namely humans. Allah created the human ancestor, Adam, from a simple material, namely soil. Humans who are now becoming big and mature also from the essence of the soil, and various nutrients grown from the soil. Then Allah determines the time of his life in the world until the time of his death and death comes, and then Allah also determines the journey after death, namely the time when he is raised from the grave on the day of resurrection, although many people still have doubts. Humans who doubt about being resurrected later on the Day of Judgment are based on their short and simple way of thinking, namely how is it possible for humans who have died and their bodies destroyed to become one with the ground, or even become substances for plants and fruits and then be eaten by the next generation. the next and become flesh or strength for other humans, how can all of this be resurrected as before when that person is still alive with a fresh and healthy body. If the ability of the mind cannot reach or cannot understand God's power in resurrecting human beings who have died, they should realize that the knowledge and abilities of the mind are indeed limited. We don't even know when the Doomsday will come. All of that is part of Allah's knowledge and power as stated in surahh al-A'raf\/7 verse 187: ¦ Verily the knowledge of the Last Hour is with my Lord; no one (one) can explain the time of occurrence other than him¦ (al-A'raf\/7: 187) Allah directs His words to the polytheists who associate partners with Allah. Allah in this verse shows again the proofs of His oneness and His power to resurrect people on the Day of Judgment. He was the one who created this human descendant of Adam from the essence of the soil. Every human occurrence must contain elements of soil substances. If we pay attention to the process of human occurrence, it is even clearer that it happened from the ground. Human occurrence in the womb begins with germfah, namely the mixing of male sperm cells (sperm) with female egg cells (ovum). Due to assimilation with nutrients, the mixed nutfah develops into a fetus, then that state changes until it becomes a baby. Living cells are composed of various substances and the substance itself is essentially composed of dead chemical elements such as iron, water, which comes from the soil. Likewise, food substances, both from plants and from animal flesh, are composed of chemical elements originating from the soil. From these food substances, seminal cells are also formed in humans or animals. Thus by the nature of the Almighty Allah, the dead chemical elements become living cells and finally become human beings. Scientist's Opinion on the Creation of Humans: Until now there is no scientific theory that can directly explain how the creation of humans from the ground. But indirectly, several theories that have developed about the origin of life explain that soil plays an important role at the beginning of the process. Most theories of the origin of life are developments on an old concept: Abiogenesis which is defined as the descent of life from non-living matter. Abiogenesis was long considered the most acceptable concept for the theory of the origin of life until the law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo = origin of life from other life) became more popular with the development of modern microbiology. The deepening of the concept of Abiogenesis generally examines the initial process of the formation of important chemical compounds that make up living things (amino acids, proteins, and so on, up to DNA) naturally without any previous life. The most famous success is the theory of primitive soup (Soup Theory) when Urey & Miller's (1953) experiments succeeded in synthesizing organic molecules from inorganic gases (Methane, Ammonia and Hydrogen) in simulated conditions such as the initial state of the earth was formed. This result was developed by Joan Oro (1961) who succeeded in synthesizing protein from cyanide solution. Of the several theories of Abiogenesis that have developed, at least two of them discuss the possibility of the origin of life from soil (and rocks). Clay theory is the theory closest to the translation of the verse above, developed by Graham Cairns \"Smith (1985) since the 1960s. Clay (English: Clay, loam) is a mineral that forms the finest particles of soil and rock formed as a result of weathering of rocks, which can also be formed from dissolved silicates. Clay minerals, like other minerals, retain their original structure during growth. Certain clay mineral masses can affect their environment in such a way that there is a tendency for replication to occur in subsequent forming processes. Clay minerals also have cation exchange power that can bind various types of elements and molecules both on the surface and in the crystal lattice. This situation allows for a process of natural selection in which certain molecules are captured. A sufficiently complex protoorganic molecule can be catalyzed by the surface properties of clay minerals. The final stage of this process is the formation of new (organic) compounds which are also capable of reproducing themselves. Deep hot biosphere. This theory was developed by Thomas Gold in the 1990s which stated that life did not originate on the surface of the earth but several kilometers beneath its surface. It is now known that microbial life is quite abundant up to five kilometers below the earth's surface in the form of archaea which generally belong to the same age or even earlier than the time when bacteria first formed. It was argued that if the discovery of the origin of life under the surface of other planets in the solar system would increase the credibility of this theory. Another theory that is developing is \"Primitive Extraterrestrial\" or exogenesis which discusses the possibility of the origin of life from outside the earth. The latest development, with the development of the study of DNA, more and more scientists (scientists) believe that life can only occur with the brilliant design of a creator. After presenting scientists' opinions regarding the creation of humans from clay, the question arises, if Allah has the power to create living cells from dead substances, why does Allah not have the power to resurrect humans on the Day of Judgment? Isn't there real evidence in the process of human occurrence itself that shows God's power to hold the resurrection day? Allah also determines two events for humans that cannot be avoided, namely the time of his death and the time of his resurrection from the grave. Neither the appointed time for death nor for the resurrection of anyone except Allah knows. Even though the polytheists know their own events clearly and the limited age of them, all of which proves the power of Allah to determine the day of resurrection, they still have doubts. They should be able to draw a lesson from the evidence. If Allah has the power to create dead matter into one and then gives it life and determines its development, surely Allah also has the power to put dead matter back together and bring it back to life according to His will."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that Allah is the one who has the right to be worshiped, who receives the prayers and hopes of all His creatures in the heavens and on earth. \"Allah\" is a great name for God Rabbal 'alamin, which was known by the Arabs before Islam. When asked about a God who had the right to be worshiped, the Arabs would answer \"Allah.\" The God who has the attributes they know is what they worship. Another verse that is in line with the intent of this verse is the word of Allah: And He is the Lord (who is worshiped) in the heavens and God (who is worshiped) on earth and He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing. (az-Zukhruf\/43: 84) These two verses, namely al-An'am\/6:3 and az-Zukhruf\/43:84 clearly glorify Allah because of His power to revive people who have died, and moreover because of His special self in knowing the day of His resurrection and His oneness in divinity and the oneness of His being worshiped in the heavens and on earth. It is only to Allah that the prayers of all creatures in the universe are addressed. Then Allah confirmed that He knows everything that they keep secret or reveal, both their words and deeds and everything that is written in their hearts. Everything that is attempted by humans, does not escape the knowledge of God. Good deeds will be rewarded, bad deeds will be punished. God's attention is perfect for human actions because all deeds will get a reward from Him."

In fact, they don't even contemplate and don't try to seek guidance from the natural signs they see on the surface of the earth or within themselves. All the verses of the Kauniyah and the verses that confirm Muhammad's prophethood, they left them and denied them. Even though it is these verses that show the existence of God Almighty who controls and takes care of this universe and there is no God who has the right to be worshiped except Allah. If they had not turned their backs on Allah's verses due to being stubborn or fanatical towards their leaders, then the truth would have appeared to them, and they would not have contradicted the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him). In line with this verse, Allah says in surahh al-Anbiya'\/21: 2-3: Every time new verses are sent down to them from God, they listen to them while playing. Their hearts are in a state of heedlessness. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 2-3)"

Their crime is as a result of them blocking the way to acquire knowledge. What is meant by \"the right\" is the religion of Allah brought by the Prophet Muhammad, which contains religious principles, sharia laws, worship, muamalat, haram and halal, morals and so on, all of which are explained in the Qur'an. . They deny religion means denying the Qur'an as the basis of religion. If they understand the Qur'an and meditate on it, of course they will not deny the teachings of that religion. Allah confirms that someday it will prove to them the truth of the news that they always ridicule in the world. Once upon a time they experienced humiliation in this world, and destruction in the hereafter as a result of their lying to religion. Instead they witnessed the victory of the Muslims. Allah's warning to them was previously considered a passing wind. Likewise with Allah's promise for the victory of the Muslims, which later turned out to be proven, among others, by the arrival of the dry season that befell them, and the destruction of the polytheists in the Battle of Badr and other wars, as well as the victory of the Muslims with the liberation of the city. Makkah (Fath Makkah). In the Qur'an, the mockery of the polytheists is repeatedly told about the prophets and the religion of Allah. This ridicule is multi-level. First, they don't pay attention to Allah's verses and natural signs and don't want to meditate on them. Second, they belied him. This second attitude exceeds the first level, because people who are indifferent are not necessarily deniers. Third, they make fun of him. The person who denies does not necessarily come to the attitude of ridicule. This mocking attitude has reached the peak of denial. The disbelievers pass through these three levels."

			"tafsir": "Allah warns that in fact the disbelievers already know how many generations of the previous people who had been destroyed by Allah such as the people of Noah, 'ad, samud and others. They belong to generations of people who have been given strength, firmness, freedom on earth that Allah has never given to the polytheist Arabs. Their earth always gets torrential rain showers, causing prosperity and fertility. Rivers flowed through their gardens, adding to the beauty and prosperity of their land. All of God's favors and gifts given to the former people did not hinder His punishment due to the sins they had committed. The two types of sins they committed that resulted in their destruction were: First, the sin of opposing the apostles and denying their teachings and making fun of them; and second, the sin of kufr favors, namely the attitude of denying the various favors that God has given them. They even use the favors for things that are contrary to God's instructions. Many verses of the Qur'an tell about the causes of their destruction. For example, among others, the word of God: ¦ and never (also) We destroy (inhabitants) of the land; unless the people commit injustice. (al-Qasas\/28: 59) There are two kinds of God's punishment that fell on people who disobeyed, namely: First, punishment by completely destroying it until it was destroyed. Second, punishment by eliminating the independence and strength of the people so that they become a weak and despicable people. When they perish, then others who have good qualities, contrary to the characteristics of the people who were destroyed will appear to replace them. This verse warns the polytheists of Mecca that their strength and power cannot prevent Allah's punishment, as it has been inflicted on the previous peoples."

The Prophet Muhammad already knew, based on the information in the past verses, that the reason why they belied religion was that they turned their backs on the verses of the Qur'an and closed their hearts to meditate and think about events in this world. Many proofs of the oneness of Allah appear in man himself and on this earth, both in the Kauniyah verses and in verses that speak about the universe which are very clear; nothing is hazy and vague. However, the polytheists remain in disbelief. Al-Qur'an explanations of the proof of the oneness of Allah in nature do not change their position. If the revelations revealed to the Prophet Muhammad had been printed on paper and they could have witnessed them with their own eyes, and held them in their own hands, surely the disbelievers would still have said: \"This is nothing but real magic.\" Such words were driven by extreme pride and deep enmity. They still see the Divine revelation as magic, and feel themselves bewitched."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, it is explained about the opinion of the Meccan infidels regarding the apostleship. They argue that there should be an angel accompanying Muhammad who also gave warnings with him and strengthened his apostleship or Allah sent down an angel as a messenger, in fact they wanted to be able to see God (al-Furqan\/25: 7 and 21). Among the Arabs there is a belief about the existence of a relationship between Allah and His creatures. According to them, those who should be communicators (apostles) should be spiritual beings (angels). A human being, even though he has high spiritual perfection, such as reason, morals and noble manners, it is impossible for him to become an apostle, because he still associates with humans and still has physical needs, such as eating, drinking and trying. The phenomenon of belief like this was not something new at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, but had existed since the time of the Prophet Hud (al-Mu'minun\/23: 33-34). The Meccan polytheists had two assumptions regarding the position of angels in the apostleship. The first assumption is that the angels themselves become apostles. The second assumption is that the angel accompanied the Prophet and explained directly to them that Muhammad was a Prophet. Their second opinion, if it is not associated with the presence of angels directly in front of them, is not a source of dispute, because Muhammad has explained to them, that they are always visited by angels. But they saw themselves as equal to the Prophet in human qualities. Therefore, they think they can also face angels and receive lessons directly from angels. Herein lies the grave error of disbelievers, towards themselves; they reject everything that they do not get directly. Against their second assumption, Allah explains in this verse that if Allah presents an angel before them in its original form what will happen will surely be their destruction, and they will not be given the opportunity to express their faith, even doom will soon befall them. Their destruction can be caused by the awesomeness of the angel's form when the angel appears to them, or they are destroyed by the angel because they deny Allah's verses."

Because they will not see angels except forms with human characteristics. At that time doubts and doubts arose in their souls and of course they would belie the angels disguised as humans, just as they denied the Prophet Muhammad. They will express their opinion that the apostle must be an angel. Even though they don't know what the original form of an angel looks like. Thus they go round and round in a circle of doubts that have no end.

The hostility and humiliation experienced by the Prophet Muhammad was also experienced by the apostles before him. Allah's Word: How great the regret is for those servants, every time an apostle comes to them, they always make fun of him. (Yasin\/36: 30) The disdain of the Quraysh disbelievers towards the Prophet Muhammad was a continuation of human hostility towards the apostles since ancient times, so the consequences they faced were of course the same as those faced by the earlier people. This verse explains that those who ridicule and humiliate the apostles will be punished. This verse explains the sunatullah that applied to mankind in the past with Allah's messengers. This verse is also a consolation and consolation for the Prophet Muhammad, because of the humiliation of his people towards him, namely the news of the final victory for the Prophet and his followers, and the defeat of his enemies. It's just that the Prophet Muhammad's people will not receive punishment like the past peoples, namely annihilation and destruction of life.

After that let them look at themselves and compare it with the peoples who have been destroyed. The Meccan infidels were actually nomads because in general they lived as traders between regions on the Arabian peninsula. But in their wanderings as traders, they did not pay attention to the remains of people who had been destroyed, such as the Nuh and Samud people in North Arabia and the 'ad people in South Arabia. How many generations have been destroyed and then replaced by new generations as explained by Allah in verse six of this surahh. All of this should be used as material for studying the history of the nation itself, even though it will take a long time, because from the historical experience of past nations, many lessons have been learned that are useful for future generations.

This question is to refute the basis of beliefs that associate partners with Allah (shirk), because the ignorant Arabs have actually acknowledged that it was \"Allah\" who created the heavens and the earth (al-'Ankabut\/29:61 and Luqman\/31:25). Then Allah ordered the Apostle to give the answer, that \"everything belongs to Allah\". The polytheists will certainly answer that question with a similar answer. There is no other answer for them; and they will not deny it, therefore they should not rely on anything from this nature other than Allah. Only Allah is the King and Owner of this universe and everything in it. Allah, who is recognized by the polytheists as the Creator who created the heavens and the earth and who owns both, has introduced Himself through His Messenger that the quality of compassion is a necessity of His essence, the attribute of love encompasses all His creatures. He is Most Merciful to all His servants by bestowing various kinds of physical and spiritual favors upon them. If they commit a sin He does not immediately impose punishment on them, instead they are given the opportunity to repent and return to Allah's way. The sinful acts they committed that resulted in God's wrath were the result of man's own mistakes. Wasn't it because of God's love that humans were created in a state of perfect fitrah? Then they are given the opportunity to recognize and validate Him by showing the evidence that exists in humans and in this universe. Because of Allah's mercy, messengers were sent to them with books full of teachings that lead to His pleasure and prevent them from His wrath. But then it is the people who tarnish the good teachings with the various crimes they commit. They denied the verses of Allah and insulted the apostles. Allah says: And We did not wrong them, but they did wrong themselves. (az-Zukhruf\/43:76) Because of Allah's grace, the polytheists of Mecca were not destroyed like the earlier people. The Messenger of Allah said: Indeed, when Allah had finished creating this creature, Allah wrote the Book that was beside Him on the 'Throne, \"Surely My mercy precedes My wrath.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) Based on that compassion, Allah will gather all mankind on the Day of Judgment that there is no doubt about it. Justice will be served on that day. No one will be spared and forgotten. It will be a great blessing for life and human life, when everyone is sure and aware of the events of that gathering day. this awareness became the driving force for him to purify his soul and exalt his mind. Injustice that occurs in worldly life, Allah will certainly reckon with justice on the Day of Resurrection. People who harm themselves, namely people who tarnish the pure nature of their events, damage their healthy mentality and eliminate their willingness to accept Muhammad's apostles and do not want to listen to revelations, and they choose the path of disbelief, because they do not believe in the hereafter, they are the ones who loss."

They make their idols, and their priests, as protectors, which according to their i'tiqad (belief) can give them happiness or ward off misery from them. There is no real protector or helper except Allah, who created the heavens and the earth. Allah put forward His nature as Creator to emphasize the rejection of thoughts that place other than Allah as a helper; because only Allah is worthy of being asked for help. It is not proper for anyone other than Him to be used as an intermediary who can influence the divine will. Only to the Creator of heaven and earth, prayers and hopes are addressed. His will cannot be influenced by anyone. He is the God who gives sustenance, food and drink and all benefits to humans. Instead He does not need food and drink and sustenance, even He is Holy from all needs for food and drink and so on, and He does not need anyone else.

Shahadah is information that comes from knowledge, recognition and belief based on sensory absorption or responses of thoughts and feelings. What things will it witness? Then, who is the witness, so that the testimony is not doubted? The thing he was asked to witness was Muhammad's apostleship and the oneness of Allah that he taught. The disbelievers rejected him. To deal with this, Allah asked the Apostle to ask, what is the greatest testimony? The Prophet Muhammad was asked to answer, that the greatest testimony is the testimony from Allah that the Prophet had believed while the Quraysh disbelievers had denied it. Also that they were then asked for their testimony, whether there really are gods besides Allah. The Prophet Muhammad was asked to state that he had never witnessed this. All he witnessed was that God is One, and he was not responsible for their testimony. Allah has sent down the Qur'an to him to warn about doom for those who deny his prophethood and the teachings he brought which have been strengthened by the testimony of Allah. Likewise, the Qur'an was sent down to give a warning to all those who have reached the Qur'an to them. It is obligatory for them to follow the Qur'an until the Day of Judgment. Allah's testimony to Muhammad's apostleship is: First: the Book of the Qur'an as an eternal miracle. Humans are not able to imitate it both in terms of language or its meaning and its contents which contain occult news, promises of victory for the Prophet and his people against polytheists. In the Qur'an itself many questions Allah about the prophethood and apostleship of Muhammad. Second: Heavenly books such as the Torah and the Bible which describe the birth of the Prophet Muhammad as well as the characteristics and signs of his prophecy. As for Allah's testimony of His omnipotence and His omnipotence to hold the Resurrection Day, in addition to the testimony of His book, they are: First: The events of mankind and this universe, which contain many of them, show evidence of His oneness and the perfection of His attributes. . Second: The nature of human nature tends to believe in the oneness of God with His perfect attributes. Then Allah ordered Rasulullah SAW to tell the polytheists that they actually admit that there is another God besides Allah and he will not admit it as they claim. In fact, he was ordered to say that God is God Almighty, as a statement of belief that is completely opposite to the beliefs of polytheists and he is clean from trying to deify what they see as partners with Allah such as statues, idols or other names that are consonant with meaning. that ally."

There is no difference between the clergy and the people. If you make the same mistake, the law will be the same, there is no difference between the ulema and the common people.

They asked Nadhar, \"O Aba Qutailah, what did Muhammad say?\" He replied, \"I don't know what he said, but I really saw him moving his lips talking about something, and what he said were just lies like the old people did as I have told you about the past.\" Nadhar was a man who talked a lot about the past, and he spoke to the Quraysh and they enjoyed what he had to say. So Allah sent down this verse. This verse explains the factors that caused them to not believe. A group of unbelievers listened to the recitation of the verses of the Qur'an which called on them to believe in monotheism. But the sound of these verses could not influence their convictions, so they remained in disbelief. They cannot understand and understand this verse of Allah because there is a veil covering their hearts. They cannot hear Allah's verses properly as if there is something in their ear that interferes with their hearing so that Allah's verses do not touch their souls. The veil of their heart and the blockage in their hearing are actually a picture of deep fanaticism or blind piety on their part, then Allah makes it an obstacle for them to contemplate and learn about these facts. Because of this blind faith, they cannot distinguish between what is right and what is wrong, they are not willing to consider the views they adhere to and those of other people, between their religion and other religions. Every belief that is different from what they believe in, is rejected without thinking about which one is closer to the truth, and which brings more clues to the path of happiness in this world and the hereafter. When they see signs or evidences that show the truth of Muhammad's apostleship, they do not believe it, even accuse it of being witchcraft due to intense fanaticism and driven by a deep sense of hostility. They could no longer respond to the meaning of the verses of the Qur'an and their responses were limited to the words born of the verses. Their hearts are so empty in response to these verses that when they came to the Prophet Muhammad to refute his da'wah, they said these verses of the Qur'an were nothing but the tales of the ancients. In fact, in the Al-Qur'an there are many messages about the unseen, laws, moral teachings, science and so on which until the end of time still have high value. But all of this is seen by the polytheists as the same as the fairy tales and superstitions of the ancients which gave no guidance in life to humans. This shows the darkness of their hearts and minds. If they wanted to contemplate the story in the Qur'an which explains the lessons of human history, the law of cause and effect that applied to those past peoples, they would certainly not say that."

Besides preventing others, they themselves distanced themselves from the Qur'an, to show that they were strongly against it and to enforce their prohibitions.

It should be noted that this action was carried out not only because of their denial, but they were unjust people who disobeyed Allah. The emergence of sadness is natural for the Prophet, because his soul and mind that is clean and pure does not have the heart to see the misguidance and evil that exist in his people, even though he always invites and calls them to the right path. Allah forbade the Prophet Muhammad to grieve over the actions of unbelievers because previous prophets had also experienced the same thing. This prohibition is also mentioned in the word of Allah: And do not be saddened by their words (Muhammad). Truly, all power belongs to Allah. He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. (Yunus\/10: 65) God's Word: So don't let their words make you (Muhammad) grieve. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they reveal. (Yasin\/36: 76) Allah forbade the Prophet Muhammad to be sad because they did not believe, in the word of Allah: And be patient (Muhammad) and your patience is only with Allah's help and do not grieve over their (disbelief) and do not (also ) are narrow-minded about the deception they are plotting. (an-Nahl\/16: 127) Allah's Word: And do not grieve over them, and do not (your chest) feel cramped against their deceitful attempts.\" (an-Naml\/27: 70) The Meccan disbelievers were not innocent believe in the Prophet Muhammad. For example, they once entrusted to him matters of resolving disputes which were very dangerous for their unity, such as matters of putting the Hajar Aswad (black stone) back in its place at the Kaaba and so on. But they did not believe in the prophethood of Muhammad, the verses The Qur'an which was revealed by Allah, the Day of Judgment, the Day of Resurrection and all that Muhammad brought and conveyed. Ar-Razi in his commentary explains the four forms of rejection of the Meccan infidels, namely: 1. Their hearts recognized Muhammad as someone who can be trusted, but their mouths belie it, because they deny the Qur'an and the prophethood of Muhammad 2.They don't want to say that Muhammad was a liar, because they know a lot tul the real condition of Muhammad who never lied. According to them, it was Muhammad himself who imagined in his mind that Allah had made him a Prophet and Messenger, then he called people. 3. They always deny prophecy and treatises, even though miracles and strong arguments have been put forward, they still deny the verses of Allah, but they do not deny Muhammad personally. 4. They don't want to believe in miracles and these arguments, they even say that miracles are mere magic. From the editorial composition of this verse it is understood that Allah exalted the rank of the Prophet Muhammad. That degree would not go down even though the Meccan infidels belied and denied it. The height of this degree is understood from the word of Allah SWT, which mentions the order to follow Muhammad which is called after the order to follow Allah. Allah says: Whoever obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), he has actually obeyed Allah. And whoever turns away (from obedience), then (know) We did not send you (Muhammad) to be their guardian.

Allah swt said: And if they (the polytheists) denied you (Muhammad), so did the people before them, the people of Nuh, 'ad, and samud (also denied His messengers) (al-hajj \/22: 42) Word of Allah swt: And if they deny you (after you have warned), then indeed, the messengers before you have also been denied. And only to Allah all matters are returned. (Fathir\/35: 4) From the meaningful verse (until Our help comes to them) it is understood that the previous prophets and messengers were very steadfast and patient in facing all kinds of actions of their people no matter what happened. Because of such actions Allah inflicted upon them great calamities, such as lightning strikes, great earthquake shocks, storm attacks and so on, Allah saved the prophets and messengers and their believers from the great punishment and saved them from the actions of their people who disavow it. This verse is entertainment for the Prophet Muhammad in dealing with the treatment and actions of the polytheists of Mecca, because just as the previous prophets and messengers were saved by Allah, surely He saved the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims, and won the religion of Islam. This consolation is explained again firmly in another word of Allah SWT: So be patient with you (Muhammad) as the patience of the apostles who have steadfastness and do not ask for punishment to be hastened for them. On the day they see the promised doom, they will feel as if they were staying (in the world) for only a moment during the day. Your job is just to deliver. So none will be destroyed except the wicked (disobeying Allah). (al-Ahqaf\/46: 35) Word of Allah swt: And be patient (Muhammad) with what they say and leave them in a good way. (al-Muzzammil\/73: 10) Allah also emphasized that Allah's help and promises that have been established will not change in the slightest, both the word of the promise itself and the intent and content of the promise. This verse also suggests to the Prophet Muhammad that stories related to the attitudes and actions of the ancients towards their prophets and messengers as well as the steadfastness, patience and help of Allah to the prophets and apostles and their followers have been conveyed by Allah in surahh al-An'am\/6 this. With this verse Allah also promises help and victory to the Prophet and those who believe. This is also confirmed by the word of Allah swt: Verily We will help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of the world and on the day when the witnesses appear (the Day of Resurrection) (al-Mu'min\/40: 51) Allah's Word: So that Allah will reward (reward) those who believe and do good from His bounty. Indeed, He does not like those who deny (disbelieve). (ar-Rum\/30: 45) The verses above and the previous verses explain the conditions for the arrival of God's help to believers, namely: 1. Have faith truly and wholeheartedly. 2. Always uphold rights and act fairly. 3. Always be steadfast and patient in any circumstances in facing God's trials."

So Allah suggested that Muhammad saw not grieve over their attitude, and surrender their situation to Allah. Allah will raise them from their graves on the Day of Resurrection and will punish them as a reward for their disbelief."

They still demand that evidence and information be revealed as it was revealed to the ancient peoples, but they do not want to think about and take lessons from the sunnah of Allah that applies to people who receive such evidence and information and the consequences experienced by those people. before, that is they were crushed to pieces in this world and in the hereafter will receive a painful punishment, because they remained in denial and did not pay attention to the evidences and explanations. The polytheists of Mecca did not want to know how Allah loves them, that is why Allah did not send down evidence and information as revealed to the people before, so that they would not be destroyed in this world, so they would have the opportunity to repent and do good. , but they do not want to be grateful for the blessings of Allah that have been sent down to them, but still deny and disobey. In fact, Allah Almighty sent down what they asked for, but Allah did according to His will, He only sent down evidence and information, He did not send down evidence and information based on the requests and desires of the polytheists, especially if the request was solely to weaken and troubled the Prophet."

Everything that crawls on the surface of the earth, everything that flies in the air, everything that lives in the oceans, from the smallest to the largest, from the visible to the hidden, only He creates, develops, regulates and maintains it. God's creatures that live in this world are not only limited to human types, but there are still many kinds and varieties of other creatures. In fact, there is still much that is not known by humans. All of them submit and serve themselves to Allah, follow His commands and stop His prohibitions. The meaning of the word dabbah in this verse is: All creatures that Allah created on earth. It is called \"animals on earth\" because it is the animals on earth that are easily seen and noticed by humans. In another verse Allah mentions that apart from the earth, there are also living things on other planets. Allah swt says: And among His signs (greatness) is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the crawling creatures that He spread over them. And He Almighty collects them all when He wills. (asy-Shura\/42: 29) The existence of living creatures mentioned by Allah on other planets, as mentioned in this verse, is a knowledge given by Allah to humans, and as material for thought and investigation. This verse encourages believers to investigate all kinds of life in Allah's creatures that exist in nature, to strengthen their faith and increase their obedience and submission to Allah Almighty. Allah states that in the Qur'an there are religious principles, norms, laws, wisdom and guidance for human happiness in this world and in the hereafter and the happiness of creatures in general. According to Ibn 'Abbas, what is meant by \"al-kitab\" in this verse is \"Ummul Kitab\", namely Tablets of Mahfudh. Because according to him the meaning of this verse is: everything has been written in the Lawh Mahfudh. According to Ibn Kathir, there is not a single creature that Allah forgets in giving its sustenance, as Allah SWT says: And there is not a single moving creature that lives on earth, but all of them are guaranteed by Allah for its sustenance. He knows his residence and where it is kept. All (written) in a real Book (Lauh Mahfudh). (Hud\/11: 6) All creatures created by Allah, both in the heavens and on earth, will die and return to their owner, namely Allah. Then He will raise them up and gather them to reward good deeds and punish bad ones."

They think that all of that is simply because of the results of their own efforts. Therefore, they grow arrogant and arrogant, are not grateful to Allah, they even make the favors as a tool to increase their power and greatness. If those who disbelieve are happy and content with the favors that Allah has given them, and think that what they have earned is truly their right, then Allah will inflict punishment on them suddenly, so that they will grieve and despair. hope of God's grace. Rasulullah saw said: \"When you see Allah giving a servant the pleasures of the world that he likes, while he continues to disobey him, then that is istidraj ) (omission).\" (History of Ahmad, ath-thabrani and al-Baihaqi) From this verse it is understood that some of God's trials to humans are in the form of misery and suffering and some are in the form of pleasure and luxury. Those who believe and are given trials of tribulation and suffering are usually patient and steadfast, and draw closer to Allah and ask Him for help. When they are given trials of pleasures and luxuries they give thanks to Allah, remember the rights of the needy and poor around them and spend part of their wealth in the way of Allah. They believe that the pleasures and luxuries are only temporary, while the real and eternal pleasures and luxuries are in the hereafter. On the other hand, when people who disbelieve in Allah are given trials of tribulation and suffering, they despair and disbelieve in Allah more. If they are given pleasure and luxury, they say that everything they get, they get from their own efforts, without anyone's help. This verse indicates that in general many humans are steadfast and patient when given trials of suffering and adversity, but many forget themselves and grow in denial when given trials of pleasures and luxuries. This verse is a warning and a lesson for believers, that all kinds of things that Allah brings to them, whether in the form of calamities and suffering or in the form of pleasures and luxuries, all of this is a trial for them, so that their faith will grow stronger, therefore they must tough and patient with it. Rasulullah saw said: It is amazing the condition of those who believe, because everything that befalls him is good for him, and that is not found in anyone, except for believers.

			"tafsir": "The apostles who were sent were ordinary people, they were tasked with conveying Allah's religion to their respective people. Unlike the Prophet Muhammad, he was tasked with conveying the religion of Allah to all mankind. They give good tidings to those who follow his call with a reward that is multiplied from Allah, giving warnings and threats to those who deny the message with a great punishment. The apostles were not like the apostles that unbelievers wanted, namely people who could perform miracles, had abilities beyond ordinary human capabilities, such as having knowledge that exceeded human knowledge, he was not human, but like an angel, or had powers such as the power of God and so on. In this verse, Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to explain to the polytheists that he was a Messenger sent by Allah, he was an ordinary human being, he did not have Allah's treasury in him, he did not know the unseen and he was not an angel either. What is meant by \"treasury\" is a place to store goods, especially valuables belonging to oneself or another person that are entrusted to the person holding the treasury. The disbelievers assume that the Prophet Muhammad, if he was truly a Messenger of Allah he must be the treasurer of Allah. Therefore, they asked the Prophet Muhammad to give and distribute to them valuable items stored in the treasury and use them. The opinion of the disbelievers is an assumption that is very far from the truth, because Allah is the owner of all this nature, as Allah says: To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is in them; and He is Almighty over all things. (al-Ma'idah\/5: 120) In taking care of and managing His possessions, Allah does not need anything, as Allah says: ¦ And He does not find it hard to care for both, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. (al-Baqarah\/2: 255) Allah confirms that He is the one who owns the treasures of the heavens and the earth, His words: Whereas the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah, but the hypocrites do not understand. (al-Munafiqun\/63: 7) The Messenger's task is only to convey Allah's religion to humans according to his abilities as a human being. He cannot do something that man is unable to do, unless God so wills. Because of this, he will not be able to provide sustenance to his poor followers, cannot win his followers in war solely because of his power, he cannot know whether someone has truly believed in him after being guided or keeps someone in the kingdom. in disbelief. Allah swt said: It is not your (Muhammad) obligation to guide them, but it is Allah who guides whom He wills¦ (al-Baqarah\/2: 272) Allah's Word: Indeed, you (Muhammad) cannot guide to those you love, but Allah guides whom He wills, and He knows better those who accept guidance. (al-Qasas\/28: 56) The Prophet could indeed give instructions, but guidance in the sense of irshad and bayan (guidance and explanation), not guidance in the sense of taufik. Allah swt said: And indeed, you really guide (man) to the straight path. (asy-Shura\/42: 52) Therefore if the disbelievers ask Muhammad saw something strange, such as flowing rivers in the desert lands of Arabia and there are beautiful gardens there, bringing down the sky clumps to punished them, Allah showed them angels, of course Muhammad would not be able to fulfill it even impossible for him to fulfill it. Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to confirm to the disbelievers that he never said, he knows the unseen that is not known to humans, because he was not given the ability to know it. There are two kinds of unseen things, namely: a. Absolute (essential) unseen that is not known by any creature, including angels. Only Allah knows it. This is the occult referred to in the verse above. Allah swt said: Say (Muhammad), \"There is nothing in the heavens and on earth who knows the unseen, except Allah. And they do not know when they will be resurrected..\" (an-Naml\/27: 65) If Allah He wills, then He informs His Messengers of this kind of unseen, like telling the Prophet Musa a person from the Children of Israel who killed his brother, after the murdered brother came back to life, after being hit with part of a cow that had been slaughtered. Another example is telling Prophet Isa that afterward, Allah will send an apostle from the line of Ishmael and so on. b. Relative (relative) occult, namely that which is not known by some beings, but is known by others. The reasons why some creatures know it, and some others don't know it, include: 1. Knowledge. Knowledgeable people are more able to know the essence of something according to their field of knowledge than people who are not knowledgeable. 2. The experience of doing a job, such as the movement of something indicates that there is a force that moves it and so on. 3. Hunches or conscience, about whether something exists or not. This hunch or conscience is obtained by a person because of the cleanliness of his soul, or because of the exercises he usually does for that purpose. This unseen unseen is not included in the occult mentioned above which only Allah knows about. Some commentators make the verse \"wala aquluLakum inni malak\" as an excuse to strengthen their opinion that angels are at a higher level than humans. But if you really pay attention, this verse is not intended to explain who is more important between angels and humans. This verse only explains who and how an apostle really is. As it is known that according to the beliefs of the ignorant Arabs at that time, an angel is a creature of Allah whose level is higher than that of humans. Angels know the unseen and what humans do not know. Among them there are those who say that angels are children of God. Because of that they argue that the prophets and apostles are not from ordinary humans, at least on the same level as the angelic level. They asked the Prophet Muhammad to show them the angel and let Allah send the angel to them. To argue and give explanations to the polytheists. as if the Prophet Muhammad told them to follow their opinion first by saying \"wala aquluLakum inni malak\" (and I did not tell you, that I am an angel). Then Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to confirm to the polytheists that what he conveyed was nothing but a revelation from Allah, not something the Prophet had made up. The Prophet Muhammad was known from his childhood as al-Amin, \"the most trusted\". He was commanded by Allah to deliver whatever revelations he received. Allah has named him as al-balagul mubin (the real messenger). But criticism of him has also been conveyed, such as the case of Abdullah bin Ummi Maktum. Then Allah emphasized that the nature of God and human nature is not the same between those who are blind and those who see, those who are guided and those who are not guided, the nature and duties of Allah are not the same as those of humans, as well as between the characteristics and duties of angels and the characteristics and duties of Messengers. Pay attention to these differences, so that it is clear which one is right, which one is wrong, which one to follow and which one to avoid. Only people who don't want to use reason can't see the differences."

Are they those whom Allah has blessed among us? Are we going to be their followers? So get rid of them from you, hopefully if they have been eliminated, we will follow 'you.\" So Allah revealed this verse. In this verse Allah ordered His Messenger to warn and convey Allah's threat to those who deny his call, after in the previous verses Allah ordered to convey the treatise. This is reasonable, because the person who was given the warning and threat had reached him with the Messenger's call and his lesson, so that he could benefit from the teaching, in accordance with the word of Allah swt: Verily what is can you warn only those who fear (the punishment) of their Lord (even if) they do not see Him and those who pray. And whoever purifies himself, verily he purifies himself for the good of himself. And to Allah is the place return. (Fathir\/35: 18) Word of Allah SWT: Verily, you are only giving a warning to those who want to follow the warnings and those who fear the Most Merciful God, even if they do not see Him. So give them the good news of forgiveness and a glorious reward. (Yasin\/36: 11) Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to give a warning to those who have believed, who have acknowledged the existence of the hereafter, and that there is a day when humans face Allah to account for all their actions that they have done in this world, and no one can help another, as stated in the word of Allah SWT: (That is) on the day (when) someone is completely powerless (to help) other people. And all matters on that day are in the power of Allah. (al-Infithar\/82: 19) Those who truly believe always try to perfect their piety to Allah, always seek His pleasure, without depending on others such as saints and pious people. They believe and believe that faith, charity and cleanliness of soul can free them from all the torments of Allah. As for the disbelievers, they do not need to be warned, because warnings and threats are of no benefit to them, they do not believe in the slightest that faith, charity and cleanliness of soul can deliver them from Allah's torment."

The only authority to judge everything is Allah because He is the Owner and Ruler of this universe. Believers are not slaves nor are they messengers or employees of the Apostles, they are servants of Allah who always seek His pleasure, while the Messenger is Allah's messenger whose job is to convey revelation to humans. Allah SWT says: So give a warning, because you (Muhammad) are only a warner. You are not the one who has power over them. (al-Gasyiyah\/88: 21-22) By therefore, never let the Prophet Muhammad expel those who worship and serve themselves, that morning or evening. If the Prophet saw, did Yes, it means that he is one of the wrongdoers, because the only one who has the authority to judge and reward him is Allah alone."

			"tafsir": "The parable described in the last verse is a kind of trial and test by Allah to those who believe. Trials are deliberately given by God to test and strengthen the faith of someone who truly believes, is steadfast and patient in facing these trials, whereas people who lack or do not have faith will definitely not be steadfast and patient in facing them. Trials and tests are given by God in various forms. Sometimes the trials are in the form of differences between humans; some are rich, some are poor, some are strong and some are weak, some are powerful and some are controlled, some are oppressive and some are oppressed and so on. Likewise, some are stupid and some are smart, some are healthy and some are sick and so on. People who are weak in faith will feel humiliated by the words of unbelievers, \"Those who embrace Islam are just stupid people, poor people and people from low castes.\" Or the words of those who disbelieve, \"That we are the ones who are loved by Allah because we are given abundant sustenance and high knowledge by Allah.\" Etc. Meanwhile, people who have strong faith are not affected in the least by such words, even their faith is strengthened because of it. Allah is the one who determines the gift and addition of favors to a servant of His. Giving these favors to test who is grateful and who is denying. If humans are grateful, they will be more enjoyable. However, those who disobey will be punished. Allah swt said: And (remember) when your Lord announced, \"Indeed, if you are grateful, I will surely add (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then My punishment will be very severe.\" (Ibrahim\/14: 7)"

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah commands the Prophet Muhammad and believers to say \"greetings\" to believers they meet, or when they part from one another. The greeting is sometimes \"salamu'alaikum\" or \"assalamu'alaikum\" or \"assalamu'alaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh\", and is followed up by maintaining peace. The word \"salam\" means \"safe\", \"prosperous\" or \"peaceful\". \"As-Salam\" is one of the names of Allah, which means that Allah is safe from traits that are not worthy of him, such as being weak, poor, new, dead and so on. The greeting \"salam\" that Allah commands believers to say in this verse, implies that Allah declares to those who have converted to Islam, that they are safe and prosperous by entering Islam, because their sins have been forgiven, their souls and their blood has been preserved by the Muslims, and they have followed the instructions that lead them to the happiness of life in this world and in the hereafter. Therefore, fellow Muslims should not fight, let alone be hostile. Some commentators are of the opinion that what is meant by \"salam\" in this verse is the \"greeting\" that the Prophet Muhammad had to say to the believers who were considered lowly and poor by the Quraysh, who came to the Prophet when he was praying. talk to the Quraysh dignitaries. Let them not be driven out, so that it hurts his heart. Even if they are poor, their position is higher in the sight of Allah, so say good words to them or tell them to wait until the conversation with the Quraysh officials is over. According to this group, their opinion is in accordance with the reason why the verse was revealed. To those who convert to Islam, Allah promises to bestow His mercy on them, as a mercy from Him. Among the blessings bestowed upon by Allah are that those who: 1. commit immorality without knowing that it is an immoral act. 2. Doing the prohibition because they are not aware, because they are very angry or because they are driven by lust. Then they repent, and regret their actions, they promise not to repeat it again, and make improvements by doing good deeds, and eradicate the influence of bad work in their hearts, until their hearts and souls are clean, and they grow closer to God. From this verse, a basis for determining punishment can be taken that things that can eliminate, reduce or mitigate the punishment of a person who will or has been sentenced, namely: 1. The mistake he made was done unconsciously, or the act was done without his will and effort. 2. His actions or behavior show that he has promised in his heart not to repeat that action, he has regretted doing the crime, and has done good deeds."

It is also explained that what the polytheists worship is something that cannot benefit or harm in the slightest, cannot provide help to those who ask him, and is unable to avert any calamity that befalls his worshippers. They worship other than Allah solely following their desires and desires, following the habits that were usually carried out by their ancestors, without strong evidence and arguments.

What is meant by the unseen is something whose real essence is unknown, such as the hereafter, heaven and hell. Even though man has been given a lot of knowledge by God, that knowledge is only a little when compared to God's knowledge. There is so much that is not known by humans. Truly Allah created this world with all its contents, equipped with rules and laws that govern it from its existence until the end of its existence. Those terms will not change one bit. Then Allah taught people some rules and regulations to convince them that it was Allah who created everything so that they would serve Him. Therefore if there are humans who claim that they know the unseen, then their knowledge is only conjecture and conjecture, not reaching the true nature. They also do not know for sure the consequences and wisdom of an event. Believing in the unseen is one of the pillars of faith. Among the unseen things that are unknown to humans are mentioned in the word of God: Indeed, only with Allah is the knowledge of the Day of Resurrection; and He who sends down the rain, and knows what is in the wombs. And no one can know (with certainty) what he will do tomorrow. And no one can know on which earth he will die. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing. (Luqman\/31: 34) Knowledge of the unseen is only known to a person if Allah teaches him, as He says: He knows the unseen, but He does not show anyone about the unseen. Except for the apostles whom He pleases, then indeed He makes guardians (angels) in front of them and behind them. (al-Jinn\/72: 26-27) Among the unseen things that God has ever taught or told His prophets are: Prophet Isa was taught by God to know what someone eats and stores in his house, His words: ¦ and I will tell you what you eat and what you keep in your house¦ (ali 'Imran \/ 3: 49) Similarly to the Prophet Yusuf, the word of Allah swt: He (Yusuf) said, \"Whatever food will be given to you both I have been able to explain the takwil, before (the food) reaches you. (Yusuf\/12: 37) Then Allah explains the breadth of His knowledge, that is, besides He knows the unseen, He also knows more about the nature and conditions that can be reached by the five senses human being, He knows everything that exists on land and in the sea from the smallest and subtlest to the greatest, from the place and time of the fall of a leaf, the state of the most subtle objects that are in the darkest night, whether their condition is good valid or dry, everything is in Allah's knowledge written in the Lawh Mahfudh. Rasulullah saw said: Allah has existed and others have not existed, and it is His Throne on the water, and He wrote everything on the Mahfudh Tablet and He created the heavens and the earth.

By putting humans to sleep at night and waking them up during the day and with that time cycle, their lifespan will end.

From this verse it is understood that humans should serve themselves to Allah, because all knowledge, power, independence, ability to move and be creative are gifts from Allah to them. He can increase or withdraw His grace whenever He wants. When He revokes all of His gifts, humans have no meaning in the slightest. Allah also sends human beings guardian angels who watch over them and record their actions at all times. Everything is recorded and nothing is left behind. Word of Allah swt: And when the sheets (charity records) have been opened wide. (at-Takwir\/81: 10) Regarding guardian angels, this is stated in the word of Allah SWT: And verily for you there are (angels) who watch over (your work), who are noble (in the sight of Allah) and who record (your deeds), they know what you do. (al-Infithar\/82: 10-12) Even for every human being there are several angels who keep guarding him in turn and some who record his deeds, namely Raqib and Atid, as Allah says: For him (man) there are angels -angels who always take care of him in turn, from the front and behind him. They guarded it at the command of Allah. (ar-Ra'd\/13: 11) Word of the Prophet: The angels take turns guarding you, namely the angels of the night and the angels of the day, they meet (alternate their turns) at the time of the dawn prayer and the time of the afternoon prayer. Then the angels who watch over you at night ascend to the sky, so God asks them (while He knows better than them) \"How did you leave My servants.\" They replied, \"We left them in a state of prayer and we came to them in a state of prayer too.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah) Actually, Allah does not need a recording angel to record all human actions, because He is All-Knowing of everything. With the existence of a recording angel who records all human actions, it is hoped that humans will be careful if they want to do a job, whether the work is pleasing to God or not. Thus the guardian angels and recorders guard, supervise and record all human actions, until the time when death comes to him. With the arrival of the angel of death to take human life to carry out Allah's command, the death of the human will come, Allah SWT says: Say, \"The angel of death entrusted to (take your life) will kill you, then to your Lord, you will be returned.\" (as-Sajdah\/32: 11)"

But after the difficulties and dangers were avoided, they forgot the promise they had made, and they even became unjust and associated partners with Allah.

			"tafsir": "This verse instructs the Prophet Muhammad, if he sits with unbelievers, and they make fun of Allah's verses and religion, he should leave them immediately unless they turn their conversation to another matter. This action was carried out so that the disbelievers realized that their actions were not liked by Allah and the Muslims, or if the Prophet continued to sit with them, it meant that the Prophet seemed to approve of their actions. The Prophet Muhammad and his companions as well as the Muslims at all times were ordered to leave those who made fun of the verses of the Qur'an. This includes all kinds of actions whose purpose is to make fun of Allah's religion, to interpret and interpret the verses of the Qur'an just because it follows his wish. If these verses are connected with the verses that command Muslims to fight against those who oppose Islam, it is as if these two verses are contradictory. This verse seems to tell the Muslims to be patient no matter what the unbelievers do to them. While other verses command to kill unbelievers wherever they are found. The answer is that these verses were revealed during the time of the Prophet Muhammad, still in Mecca, when the Muslims were still weak, at that time the main task of the Prophet was to convey the teachings of monotheism. At this time there were no orders to fight and indeed there was no wisdom in being ordered to fight. After the Prophet was in Medina, and the condition of the Muslims was strong, and there was an order to fight, then the attitude of allowing the actions of those who made fun of Allah's religion was a disgraceful attitude, and even ordered that the Muslims retaliate for their actions. Then Allah warned the Prophet Muhammad, that if he was forgotten by Satan about Allah's prohibition to sit with people who make fun of that religion, then remember that he immediately stood up and left them, do not sit with them. What is meant by \"the Prophet forgot\" here is to forget ordinary things, just as ordinary people also forget. But the Prophet never forgot the things that Allah ordered him to convey. The commentators agree that the Prophet Muhammad once forgot, but not because of interference by Satan, as Allah says: ¦ And remember your Lord when you forget ¦ (al-Kahf\/18: 24) Prophet Adam once forgot, as Allah says: ¦ but he forgot, and We found no strong will in him. (thaha\/20: 115) The Prophet Musa never forgot, the word of Allah swt: He (Musa) said, \"Don't punish me for my forgetfulness and don't burden me with any difficulties in my affairs.\" (al-Kahf\/18: 73) The Prophet Muhammad, once forgot when he was praying, then he said: \"I am nothing but an ordinary human being like you, I forget as you forget, therefore if I forget, then remind me.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abdullah) Allah confirms that satan can only affect people who are weak in faith, whereas against people who have strong faith, satan is unable to influence them and makes them forget Allah. Allah swt said: Indeed, the devil will not affect those who believe and put their trust in God. His influence is only on those who make him a leader and on people who associate him with Allah. (an-Nahl\/16: 99-100) Based on the information above, it can be concluded that Satan is not able to make a believing servant forget something, let alone make the Prophet forget something, because he cannot control God's faithful servant. In this verse it is stated that Satan made the Prophet forget that it is only a custom in language, that all kinds of bad deeds are caused by the actions of Satan, even if those who do it are not Satan. If a servant who has a strong faith forgets, then his forgetfulness is only because of the influence of his own heart and soul, not because of the influence or interference of Satan. Some scholars stipulate laws based on this verse, as follows: 1. It is obligatory to distance oneself from people who are toying with Allah's verses, or people who interpret Allah's verses simply because they follow their desires, if they are unable to admonish them to stop doing that. 2. It is permissible to sit together to discuss something useful with disbelievers, as long as they do not make fun of Allah's religion."

However, he only worships Allah alone, Who has power, Who gives benefits or harm and Who controls creatures, Who gives life and death. People who think naturally, of course, can distinguish between what is good and what is bad, and what is right and what is wrong; Indeed, serving oneself to a substance that can be hoped for by His benefits and being afraid of His punishment, is more important and better than serving oneself to something that cannot be expected to benefit, serving oneself to Allah is better than returning to a misguided path and wallowing in polytheism. In summary it can be said that worshiping other than Allah is not appropriate for the following reasons: 1. People who think naturally will ask for help from the Almighty, who can bring benefits and reject harm. 2. They don't want to apostatize like they were before embracing Islam. 3. People who have received guidance from Allah and are saved from the abyss of error, it is impossible for anyone to be led astray again, as confirmed by Allah in His word: And whoever is guided by Allah, then no one can lead him astray . Isn't Allah Almighty and has (the power to) punish? (az-Zumar\/39: 37) In this verse it is described that those who apostatize after believing are like people who are touched by Satan's whispers, or like people who are confused in achieving something that they themselves do not know how to achieve. They are in a state of indecision, because they feel that they are at a crossroads. They have left the straight path and taken a misguided path with no direction and purpose. In the midst of this confusion they are described as if they are called by their faithful friends to return to the straight path, but they cannot fulfill the call because they have separated themselves. His views and thoughts have been directed to the whispers of satan, so that he can no longer hear the cry. This description is in accordance with the word of Allah: ¦ like the standing of a person possessed by a demon because he is mad. (al-Baqarah\/2: 275) After that Allah gave encouragement to the Prophet Muhammad to always try so that polytheists could fulfill the Prophet's call to return to the straight path and stay away from the wrong path, which confused his mind. Allah confirms that the true guidance is the guidance that Allah has sent down, which is contained in His verses. It is in the instructions that there are proofs and statements about His truth which do not contain falsehood. This call is different from the call echoed by people who follow their passions which only follow the footsteps of their ancestors. Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to tell them that the task assigned to him was to surrender his soul and body solely to Allah, the Lord of the worlds."

The heavens and the earth and everything in them were created by God harmoniously and regularly, nothing is wasted.

We did not create both except with the truth (right). (ad-Dukhan\/44: 38-39) Allah emphasized that when creating nature and establishing His laws, everything went according to His will, there was no difficulty whatsoever and nothing prevented or changed its laws. All events take place either obediently or compulsorily. That is why Allah emphasized that when He created the heavens and the earth He created them correctly, because all His commands are true and His creation is true, according to His word: Remember! All creation and affairs belong to Him. (al-A'raf\/7:54) In addition, Allah also has the power to judge all humans after they are raised from their graves and gathered on the holy day. That is the power of God that can not be matched by kings and rulers however extensive their power; because even though the kings have the power to make regulations and give punishment to those who break them, they will be powerless on the Day of Resurrection, because at that time power is only in the hands of Allah. Then Allah gave information about His power, to give understanding to all human beings that there is nothing apart from His knowledge. Allah knows all of nature, whether visible or not knowing what is done openly or in secret. He is very wise to create all things harmoniously and harmoniously according to their functions.

Prophet Ibrahim asked his father and his people whether it was appropriate for them to make idols, which they made themselves, as gods? Why don't they worship the God who created them and rules over those idols. They should have known that it was Allah who had the right to be worshiped. That is why the Prophet Abraham emphasized that he really knew that his father and his people had fallen into the valley of real error, far from the straight path. Their actions clearly stray from the teachings of revelation and deviate from common sense, because idols are nothing but statues carved out of stone, wood or metal, and so on. The idol is supposed to be lower in rank than the sculptor. They should understand that idols are not God, but they are the ones who make them God. Therefore it doesn't make sense for humans to worship other creatures even though these creatures cannot control the universe and everything in it, moreover what is being worshiped is a statue that cannot do anything."

So a question arose in his heart. \"Is this my God?\" This question is a denial of the opinion of his people, so that they are jolted to pay attention to the reasons for the denial that will be put forward. However, after the star had sunk and disappeared from his view, a belief arose that what had sunk and disappeared could not be considered God. This is the reason for the Prophet Abraham to break the beliefs of his people, that all who experience change do not deserve to be considered God. Ibrahim's conclusion is the result of correct thoughts and observations and in accordance with nature. Whoever makes such observations, will surely come to the same conclusion. Meanwhile, some commentators such as Ibnu Katsir said that Prophet Ibrahim's observations of the stars, moon and sun were not the first observations, but were Prophet Abraham's tactics to persuade his people not to worship something that appeared and sank.

Then after the moon had set from the horizon and disappeared from view, he also asked questions so that the polytheists around him would know. Ibrahim said, \"Actually, if God does not give me instructions to the right path to know and believe in His oneness, surely I will be included in the lost group, namely those who deviate from the truth and do not follow God's instructions, and worship gods. other than Allah. They prefer to indulge their desires rather than do deeds that are pleasing to Allah.\" This satire is a strict satire for his people who are lost and at the same time is a guide for people who hold on to religion and revelation.

That is why Ibrahim asked them why they rejected the monotheism religion, even though Abraham had put forward the arguments for the truth of the monotheism religion in accordance with Allah's instructions and Abraham's own beliefs. Don't they know that the idols and stars they worship have flaws while the Creator of the universe and everything in it is the Most Perfect. They should not worship a god who is lacking in nature. Then the Prophet Ibrahim emphasized his stance on their denial, namely that he was not afraid of facing calamity and the consequences of denying idols. Because their idols are inanimate objects that cannot resist harm and cannot provide benefits. Prophet Ibrahim's challenge was a response to the attitude of the polytheists who feared that Abraham would get a disaster for denying their worship, as was the case with Prophet Hud when facing his people, Allah said: We only say that some of our gods have inflicted madness on you. (Hud\/11: 54) How will their offerings bring disaster on him even though these gods cannot see and cannot hear, cannot intercede and also cannot provide intercession, unless Allah wills a disaster that arises because of the statue. If that were the case, the idols and the stars would definitely have a bad effect on someone. But not because of the influence of the idols and the stars, but solely because of the power of God.

He was a pious Prophet, but his son was a heretic, drowned with the disbelievers because he did not want to obey his father's orders. This is the opposite of the Prophet Abraham whose father was a worshiper of statues, but he himself was hanif, surrendered to Allah. Among the other pious descendants of the Prophet Abraham mentioned in this verse are David, the son of Solomon, Ayyub, Yusuf, Musa and Harun as. David and Solomon became kings who had noble morals.

Also among them there are those who were given wisdom when they were small like Yahya, Allah said: \"O Yahya! Take (study) the Book (Torah) seriously.\" And We gave wisdom to him (Yahya) while he was still a child.\" (Maryam\/19: 12) More specifically, the mention of the names of the prophets in the context of the Prophet Abraham is due to several things as described below: The prophets mentioned in the verse -the last verse, in addition to his position as a prophet, were also given different privileges. They can be grouped into three groups: The first group, which is mentioned is the son of Abraham who did not part with him, namely Isaac, then his grandson, namely Jacob, because Ya'kub is the father of children and grandchildren who carry divine teachings. Then Prophet Noah was inserted with the aim of reminding that no matter how high a person's degree, he should not forget his ancestors. Moreover, Prophet Noah was the tenth grandfather of Prophet Abraham, the noblest, because he was the first human being to prohibits the worship of idols. In verse 84 the names of the Prophets David, Solomon, Ayyub, Yusuf, Musa and Harun are mentioned. The Prophets David and Solomon are mentioned first because na both of them built a house of worship (Masjidil Aqsa), just as the Prophets Abraham and Ismail did to build the Kaaba. The mention of the Prophet Ayyub and Yusuf sequentially because both of them, although not rulers, had influence and were very close to the rulers. The two of them were combined because they had something in common, namely that each was abandoned by their families, although in the end the two of them were able to meet again. Prophet Musa and Harun were named after Joseph because Prophet Musa, who was assisted by Prophet Harun, succeeded in subduing the rulers of his time and was able to prosper his people. After mentioning the prophets who became kings, then rulers who were not kings, and prophets who subdued rulers, then it is called prophets who were defeated by rulers. The first sequence is Prophet Zakaria and Prophet Yahya, because both of them were killed by the rulers of their time. Then they were called Prophet Isa and Prophet Ilyas, because both of them were going to be killed, but Allah managed to save them. Finally, the names of the prophets related to power are mentioned, namely Ismail, Ilyasa', Yunus and Lut. In summary it can be said that every prophet who was given a book was also given wisdom or wisdom as a weapon for deciding cases besides being given a prophecy. However, not all Prophets were given the power to decide cases and were given the Book. Allah emphasized that if the polytheists of Mecca and people who have the same nature, deny the Book, wisdom and prophecy given to the prophets, then Allah will hand over the promised degree of glory to other people who do not deny what was conveyed. by the prophet.

Verily, I am Allah's messenger to all of you¦\" (al-A'raf\/7: 158) The words of the Prophet: \"All the prophet was sent only to his people, while I was sent to all mankind.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Jabir bin Abdullah) Allah explains that those who believe in the Day of Judgment and life in the hereafter, of course they believe in the Qur'an, because people who believe in the life hereafter also believe in the consequences received on that day. That is why they are always looking for clues that can save themselves in the hereafter. These instructions are contained in the Qur'an, so they will certainly believe the Qur'an, believe in the Messenger of Allah who received the book, obey Allah's commands, and perform prayers on time continuously. Salat is mentioned in this verse, because prayer is the pillar of religion, and the staple of all worship. The person who prays properly is a sign that that person likes to perform other acts of worship and can control his desires not to do what Allah has prohibited. In this verse there is a clear allusion, namely the denial of the inhabitants of Mecca and humans who have an attitude like them towards the Qur'an; and explained that they did not want to accept Islam and Muhammad's apostleship because they did not believe in an afterlife. They feel that life only happens in this world."

Their words have betrayed the teachings of the monotheistic religion. Likewise the words of those who claim to receive revelations from Allah, such as Musailamah al-Kadzdzab in Yamamah, al-Aswad al-'Ansi in Yemen, thulaihah al-Asadi from Bani Asad, and people who claim to be able to make books like Al- Koran. This Word of God contains a subtle allusion to the Jewish priests who were revered by their followers because they claimed to have received revelations from God that could be used to solve everything difficult to understand from the Torah. According to the facts, it was they who were always hostile to Muhammad. The Al-Qur'an also contains satire for Arab writers who feel they are able to compile books that can emulate the Al-Qur'an as Allah's words: ¦ if we wish, surely we can read something like this. (al-Anfal)\/8: 31) Allah mentions the threats and torments that will be received by those who are unjust, when they breathe their last breath, as a reward for the crimes and sins they have committed. How terrible it would be if the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims saw the suffering suffered by those evil people when they faced the agony of death, that is, the suffering they will experience before death, the awesomeness of which cannot be described. At that time the angel of death stretched out his hand to take the lives of those who were wallowing in sin, with a violent grip. God describes those terrible times in their reproachful tone. The angel seemed to be saying, \"If you really feel capable, release your soul from your body so that you can avoid this snatch.\" This order they would not be able to carry out, as the matter was beyond their control. At that time they could not escape the painful and humiliating punishment, because they had dared to twist the truth, tell lies, and their arrogant and arrogant attitude towards Allah's verses, such as their words that they were able to bring down a book like the Al-Qur'an. 'an. In this verse there is a clear comparison between their inability to produce a book like the Qur'an and their inability to avoid the angel of death. The intention is so that they can realize that what they say is actually just a lie, while the Qur'an is coming from Allah to Muhammad, which can not be matched by anyone else."

Their condition is as if they were created for the first time, when they were in their mother's womb, as explained in the hadith: \"O people, in fact you will be gathered in the presence of Allah in the Mahsyar field in a state of no shoes, no clothes and no circumcision as We started the first creation , that's how We will repeat it. That is a promise that We will definitely keep, that we will really carry it out.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn 'Abbas) They left in the world whatever Allah has bestowed upon them, which became their pride, namely property, children, wives and positions which made them arrogant and did not want to believe in the Messengers apostle. All of them cannot help them from Allah's torment in the hereafter. Allah makes it clear that He will not care about anything they think can give intercession; whether it be idols that they associate with Allah or priests that they consider as intermediaries who can connect their prayers to Allah. Strictly speaking, on that day, intercession and ransom were ignored, each person was responsible for his own deeds. On that day each human being is separated from everything that is usually their pride in the world. Their hopes had been dashed because what they had expected never arrived. The intercession and ransom that they thought would help them did not meet their expectations in the slightest."

God breeds all kinds of plants from the seeds of life, whether in the form of grains or seeds. It is so manifested with the intention that it is easily understood by humans, in accordance with their general knowledge; includes all kinds of life which science classifies as plants which reproduce by means of spores or by cell division which can only be known by certain people. All of them reproduce according to the law of cause and effect determined by Allah. The scientific description of this ayat is as follows: extracting the living from the dead and removing the dead from the living, is the life cycle of all living things or living organisms (often just written organisms), especially of the higher order species such as humans, animals or plants. When talking about plants\/plants, the sentence 'brings out the living from the dead, implies that the plant (the living) comes out of the seeds that are planted. These seeds can be 'considered something dead. Because if it doesn't find suitable conditions, it remains an 'inanimate object'. Whereas 'bringing out the dead from the living, implies that the seeds (the dead) come out or are produced by the plants (the living ones). The life cycle of organisms is a metabolic process that occurs in all living things; and controlled by a complex gene system. This is what is the power or verse of Allah. At the end of this verse, Allah confirms that the one who created everything has the most perfect nature, has unlimited power and has high knowledge, namely Allah. Thus, only Allah should be worshiped, and no other partners should be associated. Allah denounces the polytheists, why do they deviate from true worship, that is, deviate from the religion of monotheism towards worshiping gods other than Allah, even though if they wanted to pay attention to the events of this universe, they would know that their actions were actions that were not right."

God invites people to pay attention to the open nature that can be seen everyday. Allah raises the morning light that erases the darkness of the night. The light appears on the eastern horizon after the sun rises so that the world looks brightly lit. This situation they experience when they do all kinds of activities for the purposes of their lives. As the opposite of this atmosphere, Allah invites people to pay attention to the dark night conditions. Allah created the night to rest after they are tired from working during the day. This state is described as an atmosphere of tranquility. The atmosphere that alternates between day and night is like a situation that has similarities with the cycle of life, so that they have a broader view of life. The scientific description is as follows: The word husbana (calculation) in this verse is intended as a calendar calculation (calendar). In the history of human civilization, it has been proven that the sun and moon are used for calendar calculations. A calendar based on the sun's movement and position in the earth's sky, known as the Solar Calendar, has been carried out by Western civilization (derived from Rome and Greece), India; while Jewish, Arab, Chinese, and Indian civilizations use the Lunar Calendar, which is a calculation based on the motion and position of the moon in the earth's sky. In the language of astronomy, the Solar Calendar is based on the earth's orbit relative to the sun's position, while the Lunar Calendar is based on the moon's orbit relative to the earth's and sun's positions. In the world of astronomy-astrophysics, the moon is also used in calculations to determine the rotational dynamic stability of the earth. This proves that the existence of the moon is necessary so that the precession (circulation) of the earth on its axis is stable. The moon provides stability in the time dimension of 10-100 years, while Venus and Mars provide stability in the time dimension of 100-500 years. While the planets Jupiter and Saturn also contribute to the rotational dynamic stability of our earth, they also act as a shield for the earth against the scattering of meteors that will hit the earth. Allah mentions the causes that change the atmosphere from day to night, namely the sun which circulates according to predetermined times. In comparison, it is said that the moon looks brilliant at night. Both the sun and the moon circulate in space according to their regular and certain orbits. Allah mentions the sun and the moon because the two celestial bodies are the most prominent among the other celestial bodies, which in general humans can easily understand when the sun and moon rise and when the celestial bodies set, with the intention that humans can understand that each life was preceded by nothing and will return to nothing too. Regarding the benefits of the circulation of the sun and the moon, Allah explains further with His word: It is He who makes the sun shine and the moon shine and it is He who determines the places of their orbits, so that you know the number of years and the reckoning (time). (Yunus\/10: 5) In this verse, Allah mentions three kinds of His blessings that humans can enjoy directly, namely the blessings that they get without effort; the blessings of the morning light, the blessings of the tranquility of the night and the blessings of the sun and moon so that humans as a whole can understand God's all-encompassing mercy for all His creatures. At the end of the verse Allah confirms that creation which is of very high value, is Allah's provision in accordance with the breadth of His knowledge, the greatness of His power and the height of His wisdom. Allah says: Indeed, We created everything according to measure. (al-Qamar\/54: 49)"

Stars are used as a timepiece by observing the rising and setting of the star groups. ) As a sign of the times, it is taken as a guideline that on March 21 each year the sun sets with Aries at 6.00 pm (18.00). Then each star sinks earlier than the sun about 1 degree or 4 minutes. What is meant by timekeeping stars here are fixed stars, namely stars that shine alone and have a fixed constellation (constellation); not moving stars (planets, as-ayats) because these stars always wander among other star constellations. As a season indicator, it can be known from the sun's position among the fixed stars (manzie). For easy viewing at sunset. If the sun sets together with the constellation Hamal (Aries), it means that it is March 21, spring has begun, whereas if the sun sets together with Sarathan (Cancer) it is June 21; summer has started to arrive. If the sun sets with the constellation Mizan (Libra), then it's September 23; autumn is coming; and when the sun sets with the constellation Jadyu (Capricornus) it means that it is December 22, winter has arrived. These seasons apply to countries in the Northern Hemisphere of the Equator, while countries in the Southern Hemisphere of the Equator apply vice versa. The stars as a guide that people usually use are the fixed stars outside the horoscope (Zodiac), namely the southern cross star (as-shalibul Januby Crux) by drawing a straight line from gamma cruxis to alpha cruxis and cutting the horizon. The point of intersection is the south point. The big dipper or big bear star (ad-Dubbul Akbar, Ursa Mayor) is by drawing a straight line from beta ursaayorise through alpha ursae mayoris and cutting the horizon. The point of intersection is north. Further scientific descriptions of the benefits of the stars are as follows: The stars are used as a guide in the darkness on land and at sea, meaning that the stars can be used as navigation indicators in travel\/wandering\/sailing. In the history of human civilization, sailors from the nations of the Vikings, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Spaniards, Portuguese have used their knowledge of the position of the constellations as a navigational indicator in their distant voyages. The Constellation Cross-South (Southern Cross) has been used by British sailors as an indicator of navigation. In scientific language, navigation indicators that use or are based on the position of the stars in the sky are called stellar navigation. Stellar navigation has also been used by land nomads to determine the direction of their journey. In today's modern world, it turns out that stellar navigation has also been used by spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle: Columbia, Challenger, and Enterprise. Another use of the stars is to indicate the direction of the Qibla, where the city of Mecca is located just south of the city of Medina. Allah explains His power in creating the heavens, the earth and everything in it and all kinds of life forms and the legal system that applies to them in detail. This explanation is intended, that by examining the majesty of God's creation, the human mind becomes open to accept the belief that there is a Creator of the heavens, the earth and everything in it and the power that He has. At the end of this verse Allah mentions that the explanation given in detail is addressed to people who have clean minds and are protected from the influences of lust, that is, people who examine natural objects purely, regardless of their goals. certain interests that lead to personal interests, class and national fanatics. It is those people who examine natural objects purely that will be able to find answers to the secrets of the events of the universe which lead to God Almighty."

This explanation gives the understanding that all humans, who consist of various nations and tribes with various shapes and colors of their skin, stem from one origin, namely from Adam and Eve. They were created by Allah from one kind (from the ground) as also explained in His word: O people! Fear your Lord, who created you from one self (Adam), and (Allah) created his partner (Eve) from his (self); and from both of them Allah multiplied men and women. (an-Nisa'\/4: 1) This explanation answers the secrets of human events that are widely discussed by scientists, and as an affirmation to humans so that they do not glorify idols and stars, but let them worship only their own Creator, namely Allah The Almighty and Almighty; in order to be grateful for the blessings Allah has bestowed on them, namely that they live to know each other and help each other among human beings because they essentially have the same dignity and come from the same kind. Differences in nationality, ethnicity, shape and skin color should not be used as a reason for enmity and hatred, but should be used as a reason to establish brotherhood and gratitude for the blessings of Allah Almighty. Then God explained the process of human reproduction, that the process of breeding also took place by God's power. Man was created from sperm and ovum. Sperm comes from the male while the ovum from the female. Sperm emitted from the male fertilizes the ovum, which remains for some time in the female's uterus; After going through a certain process, a baby is born. From then on, the baby lived in the natural world until his death, then returned to the afterlife.

Allah explained that it is Allah who sends down rain from the sky, which causes the growth of various types of plants consisting of various shapes, types and tastes. As Allah says: ¦ watered with the same water, but We prefer one plant over another in terms of taste. (ar-Ra'd\/13: 4) It is said that rain falls from the sky according to their custom. \"Same\" or sky is used for whatever is above; while what is meant by Sama in this verse is \"Sahab\" which means cloud as shown in the word of Allah: Have you ever looked at the water you drink? Did you send it down from the clouds or did We send it down? (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 68-69) Allah explained that water is the cause for the growth of all kinds of plants of various types and tastes, so that people can know how Allah's power regulates the life of these plants. Humans who like to pay attention to the cycle of water circulation will be able to know how high God's laws are. His law applies permanently and continues without ceasing, until the appointed time arrives. It then mentions the details of the various plants; among them is grass that grows in clusters so that it looks green. Plants of this type produce fruit in the form of small grains collected in a stalk such as wheat, barley and rice. Another type of these plants is the palm tree which produces fruit which is collected in a bunch that hangs low so that it is easy to pick. Still other types of the various types of herbs are grapes, olives, and pomegranates. When these types of fruit are mentioned successively, because each one has similarities and differences, characteristics, shape and taste, so some are black in color and some are green in color; some have rather wide leaves, and some have rather small leaves; Likewise, some are sweet and some are sour. In this case the scientist said: Living things have been described by botanists, just as plants play an important role in making the world livable. Among their roles, plants clean the air for humans, keep the temperature relatively constant, and balance the proportions of gases in the atmosphere. Allah swt stipulates that humans and animals receive their food from what is produced by plants in their \"green factory\". This green factory, which botanists call chloroplasts, contains chlorophyll which in the Qur'an is referred to as al-khadhir (green matter), in which plants harness the energy of sunlight and convert it into chemical energy which in turn produces seeds. , fruits and other plant parts. Plant cells, unlike human and animal cells, can convert solar energy into chemical energy and store it in nutrients in very special ways. This process called photosynthesis is carried out not by cells but by chloroplasts, the organelles that give plants their green color. These tiny green organelles that can only be observed with a microscope are the only laboratories on earth capable of storing solar energy in organic matter. Photosynthesis is a chemical process, which is formulated as follows: 6 H2O + 6 CO2 +Sunlight â†' C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2 That is, water and carbon dioxide with the help of solar energy produce sugar\/glucose and oxygen. According to the American astronomer, George Greenstein, chlorophyll is a molecule that carries out photosynthesis. The mechanism of photosynthesis begins with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll molecules. Photosynthesis varies according to the intensity and duration of the sunlight source, and its productivity is measured by the output of oxygen it produces. The production made by plants is realized through very complex chemical processes. The thousands of chlorophyll pigments found in chloroplasts react to light in a very short time, about one thousandth of a second. The conversion of solar energy into chemical or electrical energy is a very recent breakthrough. The very complex system of photosynthesis is a mechanism deliberately designed by Allah swt. An 'unmatched plant carried out in small unit area on leaves. The process of photosynthesis with the role of chlorophyll and chloroplasts, is one of the divine verses, which reveals that all living things were created by Allah, the Sustainer of all nature. Related verse: al-hajj\/22: 5). All of this is to show the power of Allah who created the various plants. Allah commands humans to pay attention to the various plants when they bear fruit, how the fruits protrude from their stems or branches, then bloom as flowers, after the fruit appears, finally it becomes a perfect (ripe) fruit. At the end of this verse, Allah confirms that in the process of the fertilization event there are signs of Allah's power which is very thorough in its management and high in knowledge. The signs of Allah's power are proof for those who believe. From these verses it can be understood that human attention to all kinds of plants is only limited to the state of being born as evidence of Allah's power, not to reveal the secret of Allah's power over the creation of these plants."

Even though it was Allah who created you and what you did.\" (as-shaffat\/37: 95-96) Allah also denounces their actions, because they have lied by saying that Allah has sons and daughters.

Allah swt said: And the Jews said, \"Uzair son of Allah,\" and the Christians said, \"Christ is the son of Allah.\" (at-Taubah\/9: 30) While their accusation that Allah has daughters is explained in the word of Allah: So ask (Muhammad) to them (the Meccans), \"Are the daughters for your Lord while for them -boy?\" or did We create angels in the form of women while they witnessed (it)? Remember, among their lies they actually said, \"God had a son.\" And really, they are total liars. (as-shaffat\/37: 149-152) They threw the accusation without the slightest reason.

The potential that exists in humans can develop in accordance with the knowledge and deeds of the man himself, when he wants to choose which action to do, there are two kinds of urges to fight, the urge to do good deeds and the urge to do bad things. If people choose actions by following good impulses, surely they will see the light of truth. But if they follow bad impulses, they will surely sink into darkness. Allah confirms that the Prophet, was not given the power to be their caretaker. The prophet only invites to good, so if they do not want to accept the invitation, because they follow bad impulses, of course they will not accept the invitation, and they will still wallow in evil. At the end of this verse, Allah strengthens His explanation that the Prophet was not sent to take care of them, that is, he was not given the authority to be responsible for their actions. That is their business, for they have been given the right to vote to determine their own destiny."

			"tafsir": "Regarding the reason for the revelation of this verse, it is explained as follows, at one time the Muslims insulted the idols worshiped by the infidels, then they were prohibited from insulting them. (Narrated by 'Abd ar-Razzaq from Qatadah). Allah forbids Muslims to curse idols worshiped by polytheists to avoid insulting Allah from polytheists, because they are people who do not know the attributes of Allah and the names that should be pronounced for Him. Then it could happen that they insult Allah with words that cause the anger of the believers. From this verse it can be understood that if an action is used for the realization of another immoral act, then it should be abandoned, and any action that causes bad consequences, then that action is prohibited. This verse also gives a hint to the existence of a prohibition for Muslims that they may not do something that causes disbelievers to further distance themselves from the truth. Swearing idols is actually insulting inanimate objects. Therefore, cursing idols is not a sin. However, because cursing idols causes the polytheists to feel offended and angry, in the end they will respond by insulting Allah, then this act is prohibited. Allah gives the explanation that He made every people consider good their own deeds. This means that the measure of whether an action or habit is good or not, sometimes arises from human judgment, whether it is an act or habit that has been passed down for generations or an act and habit that has just arisen, such as the feelings of polytheists who are offended when there are people who people who curse their idols. This shows that the measure for judging whether an act or habit is good or bad is a matter of endeavor. It's just that besides that, God has given instincts to humans to judge those actions and habits, whether those actions and habits are good or bad. While the duties of the Apostle are conveying revelations that guide and direct the instincts to develop properly towards the right path so that they can judge those actions and habits with the right judgment. At the end of this verse, God gives an explanation that all human beings will return to God after they die, namely on the day of resurrection; for He is the true God and He will proclaim all the deeds that they have done in the world, and will reward them accordingly."

Then bring us some of these things, we will believe you.\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"What do you want?\" The Quraysh replied, \"Make the hill of Safa gold.\" The Prophet replied, \"If I do, do you believe in me.\" They said , \"yes, by Allah we all follow you.\" Then the Messenger of Allah prayed, then Jibril came and said, \"if you want Mount Safa to be turned into gold, but I was not ordered to bring miracles, to be belied except to be subjected to torture, or allowed to repent some of them.\" So Allah revealed this verse. Allah explained that the polytheists swore in the name of Allah with all earnestness that if the Prophet could bring about the miracles they hoped for, they would surely believe that the verses that the Prophet received were truly came from Allah and they will admit that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.This shows that their disbelief towards Allah's verses has been peaked. They actually could not understand the proofs of truth contained in the verses received by the Prophet, so they suggested that other signs of truth be sent down. This shows that they were only looking for trouble to bring down the Prophet's personality by asking for miracles to appear, even though these miracles were given based on Allah's permission and His wisdom, not depending on someone's will and wishes. Allah ordered the Prophet that in fact the verses came from Allah alone, so the power to transmit the revelation was not in the hands of Muhammad but in the hands of Allah who was given according to His will. Allah said: There is no right for a messenger to bring evidence (miracles) except with Allah's permission. (ar-Ra'd\/13: 38) After that Allah explained to the Muslims who hoped for a miracle to come to the Prophet, to fulfill the request of the disbelievers that even if miracles were sent down according to their request, they would never believe.

What is meant here is humans who behave like satans, always inviting evil and hostility. This verse explains that the Muslims face the hostility of polytheists. Likewise, Allah made enemies for each Prophet, consisting of demons, both of the human kind and of the jinn type. The devils are enemies to the prophets and the scholars who are the heirs of the prophets; also for every preacher who propagates the religion of Allah, Whenever conflicting things arise, one will definitely defeat the other, the strong will definitely destroy the weak, and be sunatullah, that the good ending and final victory will certainly be on the side of the right group. When it rains heavily there will be a flood, and it will raise a great deal of foam on the surface of the water. The foam, when blown by the wind, immediately disappears so that only the water remains on the earth. Likewise life is full of struggles; and a warrior cannot maintain his position except with persistence and patience. Likewise, the deeds that Allah accepts are only those that are done well and sincerely. This is confirmed by Allah as follows: Meaning: Or do you think that you will enter heaven, but you have not yet come to you (trials) like (experienced) by those before you. They were struck by poverty, suffering and shaken (with various trials), so that the Apostle and those who believed with him said, \"When will Allah's help come?\" Remember, verily Allah's help is near. (al-Baqarah\/2: 214) The devils who are the enemies of the prophets try to whisper to those who are seduced by beautiful persuasions to deceive them, and deceive their eyes so that they unconsciously slip from the right path. It has been clearly proven that Satan's trick was in the incident that was experienced by Prophet Adam and Siti Hawa. Satan swore gently and described to Adam that if Adam and his wife wanted to eat the fruit of khuldi (the fruit of immortality), then he would stay in heaven forever. Likewise, satan whispers to people who fall into committing disobedience. The devil whispers that they use the opportunity to live freely in this world to enjoy all the delights of life, because they do not need to be afraid of Allah's torment, because Allah is Most Forgiving and Most Merciful. If Allah had willed the demons not to deceive people, the demons would have been unable to do anything. But Allah gives freedom to humans to choose what they will do according to the instructions of their common sense and choose the path they will take, the right path or the wrong path. Because of that, the Prophet was ordered not to pay any attention to them, because later in the afterlife they will have to be accountable for all their behavior while in the world.

Because the Prophet Muhammad had lived with his people for about 40 years, before he was appointed a Prophet and during that period the Prophet had never conveyed statements about the unseen realms and about the stories of the previous apostles. The polytheists of Quraysh demanded that the Prophet Muhammad bring a miracle to prove his truth, even though they had been shown the greatest miracle, namely the Al-Qur'an which contains knowledge, with a wording that no one can imitate. This is enough evidence, that Allah has strengthened his prophethood, not by sending down the Qur'an and the explanation in it about his position as a prophet, even with the information of the Torah and the Bible, because both of these books contain statements that show that Muhammad is a prophet and messenger. Therefore, Allah commands that Muslims should never have doubts about the truth of the Qur'an.

About eating the meat of animals that are called the name of Allah when slaughtering them, there are several opinions among Islamic scholars According to Imam Malik, all animals that are slaughtered without mentioning the name of Allah when slaughtering are forbidden to eat. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, if the name of Allah is not mentioned intentionally, then eating the animal's meat is unlawful, and if it is not mentioned due to forgetting, then it is halal to eat. According to Imam Syafi'i, all animals that are slaughtered are not called by the name of Allah, either intentionally or because of it forget, then the meat is halal to eat, as long as the person slaughtering it is a Muslim. Thus if the Muslims follow the will of the polytheists regarding the halal carcasses, then they must be included in the polytheists.

God countered their claims and declared that only God knew absolutely to whom He placed the apostolic charge. Their demands are also explained by Allah Ta'ala in His words: \"And they (also) said, \"Why was this Qur'an not revealed to a great person (rich and influential) from one of these two countries (Mecca and Taif)?\" Are they the ones who distribute the mercy of your Lord? We are the ones who determine their livelihood in the life of the world.\" (az-Zukhruf\/43: 31-32) Such demands were put forward by them to the Prophet Muhammad who was associated with worldly life because they were driven by their envy and arrogance and were meant to refute the Prophet's position as Rasulullah. This is explained in the word of Allah: \"And when those disbelievers see you (Muhammad), they only treat you as an object of ridicule. (They say), \"Are these people who denounce your gods?\" Even though they are people who deny remembrance of Allah, the Most Merciful.\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 36) Quraysh leaders who insulted the Prophet Muhammad, in fact, in their hearts, they acknowledged the noble lineage, honesty and greatness of the Prophet's morals, so they gave the Prophet the nickname Al-Amin (a trusted person). . They admit that the Prophet Muhammad deserves to be the messenger of Allah. There is no other reason that hinders them from believing except because of envy, arrogance, and blind obedience to the beliefs of their ancestors. The apostolic position is purely God's gift bestowed upon whomever He wills. The position of prophethood cannot be achieved by means of business or by increasing the level of education nor can it be achieved through lineage or descent. This position is only given by Allah to those He chooses. Then Allah threatened the arrogant Quraysh leaders that they would be humiliated by Allah and grievous punishment because of their evil deeds and their deceit against the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims, as stated in His word: \"So Allah inflicted on them humiliation to the life of this world. And indeed, the punishment in the hereafter will be greater, if (only) they know.\" (az-Zumar\/39: 26) Punishment from Allah befalls those who are disobedient, because of their sins and transgressions. It's a shame that some people see this doom only as a natural disaster and do not raise awareness in their hearts that as God's punishment, some of them were killed during the Battle of Badr and some suffered an ignominious fate in life."

Indeed, satan is a real enemy to you, and you must worship Me. This is the straight path. And indeed, he (the devil) has led many of you astray. Then do you not understand? (Yasin\/36: 60-62) All those who follow the teachings of jinns and demons will be gathered together. Everyone who is a mulatto will be gathered together with his followers, both in terms of truth and evil. Then said those who became followers of the jinn as their answer to Allah, \"O our Lord, each of us has felt the pleasures of the other side. The jinns get pleasure because they have managed to lead us astray with enticements. and follow the will of lust, on the contrary we also feel happy to follow them and listen to their whispers. We feel free to wallow in the delights of the world.\" In this verse, Allah gives instructions that every human being is always accompanied by Satan who tries to seduce him with whispers that invite him to ungodliness and disobedience to Allah, so that he does not realize that this is a trick from the devil. These spirits always try to mislead people into the valley of evil and evil, just like germs that always try to cause various diseases in the bodies of humans or animals. These germs know their way into the human or animal body from subtle orifices. Likewise, Satan knows the way to enter the human heart, so that humans fall into the valley of error without realizing it. If there are germs that manage to sneak into the human body and cause disease, humans, who are more subtle in nature, can be influenced by spirits, namely jinns and demons, which can lead to human spiritual diseases. People who are followers of jinns and demons say, with great sadness and regret, \"O Lord, we have arrived at the time that You have appointed for us, after we have received worldly delights for following the invitation of jinns and satans and we have confessed our sins. our sins, we surrender ourselves to You to receive Your fairest punishment.\" Their words show their remorse and selflessness in following their passions and now they submit themselves to Allah who knows all their deeds. In this verse it is not stated how the jinn' answers and the devil's reasons that lead them astray, but it is explained in another word of Allah which shows that demons, jinn and humans who are victims of their instigation are fighting each other, releasing responsibility and cursing each other: \" ¦ then on the Day of Judgment some of you will deny each other and curse each other; and your return will be hell, and there will be absolutely no helper for you.\" (al-'Ankabut\/29: 25) In response to their complaint, Allah said, \"Hell is where you live while you are eternally in it, unless God wills something else.\" Everything is under His will and choice, and no one knows His will except He Himself. He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing God. Ibn 'Abbas understood the verse above, that no one should interfere in determining the fate of a servant of Allah, whether he will be put into heaven or hell. Everything is under the power and will of Allah."

They always help and help in various endeavors and efforts so that their wishes and efforts are fulfilled according to their plans. They do not hesitate to carry out similar acts of violence, tyranny and persecution and ignore the norms of humanity, justice and compassion, as long as they can fulfill their desires in enjoying the life of this world to their heart's content. This can be proven from various events in history since ancient times until now. How many prophets and apostles are carriers of truth, callers to the faith of monotheism, receive great and harsh challenges from idol worshipers and defenders of falsehood and deviance because these prophets and apostles persist in their convictions, are firm in their da'wah so that Allah gives punishment to their people who are misguided and disobedient like the people of 'Ad and Samud. How many nations who feel themselves to be strong and mighty blatantly seize the rights of weak nations without regard to their sense of justice and humanity. But the oppressed and colonized nation did not remain silent, they struggled in various ways to regain their independence. Indeed, it has become sunatullah that truth will win as long as the truth is defended and fought for. Allah says: And say, \"The truth has come and the falsehood has disappeared.\" Truly, the vanity must have disappeared. (al-Isra'\/17: 81) Allah did not order humans or jinn to unite and group together to do evil, do wrong and do wrong, but this is the nature of humans and society themselves, they are more interested in joining forces and helping each other. with a group that has the same direction and goals in life, even though this is intended to commit tyranny and act arbitrarily towards other members of society. Allah says: Men and women hypocrites, one and the other are (the same), they order (do) what is wrong and prevent (deeds) that are good and they clasp their hands (miser). They had forgotten Allah, so Allah forgot them (too). Indeed, the hypocrites are the wicked. (at-Taubah\/9: 67) In interpreting this verse, Qatadah said, \"Indeed, Allah has made human beings close friends because each has the same inclination; a believer is a guardian (close friend) for another believer, when and where he exists. An infidel is the guardian of another infidel, whenever and wherever he is. Faith is not just wishful thinking nor is it merely a symbol or sign. By Allah, Who has my age! If you obey Allah, you are not If you know anyone who obeys Him, then it will not harm you. And if you commit disobedience and immorality which Allah has forbidden while you are close friends with someone who is obedient and fears Him, then that will not be of any use. for you.\" Abu Shaykh narrated from Mansur bin Abi al-Aswad he said, \"I asked al-A'masy about the meaning of verse 129: 'What did you hear from the friends and tabi'in scholars?' Al-A'masy replied, \"I heard them say, \"When human morals have been corrupted, then they will be easily ruled by evil humans.\" Allah said: And if We want to destroy a country, then We order those who live luxuriously in that land (in order to obey Allah), but if they commit disobedience in that (country), then the words (Our punishment) should apply to them, then We will completely destroy (that country).(al-Isra'\/17 : 16) On the other hand, the believers are united and have leaders and confidants consisting of people who are good, honest and fear Allah Allah's Word: And those who believe, men and women, some they become helpers for some others. They order (do) what is right, and prevent from what is wrong, perform prayers, pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. They will be given mercy by Allah. Indeed, Allah is Mighty a, All-Wise.

The Qur'an and authentic hadiths show that the Prophet Muhammad was also sent to the jinn as mentioned in the following verse: they attended (the recitation) they said, \"Be quiet (to listen to it)!\" So when they had finished they returned to their people (to) give a warning.

No matter how much wealth a human being has, he still needs the help of other people, for example help from his assistants, workers, doctors, and so on. He definitely still needs the help of Allah, his Creator and the Creator of all his necessities and needs of his life, Allah says: O people! it is you who need God; and Allah He is the Most Rich (does not need anything), Most Praised. (Fathir\/35: 15) This is explained by a Qudsy hadith narrated by Abu dzar from the Prophet; he received the following revelation from God: Meaning: O My servants, I have forbidden myself to commit injustice, and I have made unjust acts also unlawful among you, so do not commit injustice to your neighbor. O My servants, all of you are in error except those whom I have guided, so always ask for My guidance and I will guide you. O My servants, all of you are hungry except those whom I give food, so ask Me for food and I will give you food. O My servants, all of you are naked except those whom I have clothed, so ask Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you always make mistakes day and night while I forgive all sins, so ask My forgiveness, I will surely forgive you. O My servants, you will never harm Me so that I may be harmed because of you and you will never benefit Me so that I can benefit because of you. O My servants, if the ancients, the later, humans and jinn all had such fear of Me, then this would not have added anything to My kingdom. O My servants, if the ancients, the later ones, humans and jinn were all evil then this would not reduce anything from My kingdom. O My servants, if the ancients, later people, jinns and humans were in a place, then they asked Me and I granted all the requests, then that would not reduce the treasury in the slightest. -My, except like a smooth needle reduces ocean water when put into it (and lifted again). O My servants, verily I record all your deeds and I will reward them perfectly, so whoever gets a good reward, let him praise Allah, and whoever gets a bad reward, let him not criticize, except himself. (History of Ahmad, Muslim, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah from Abu dzar) Such is part of Allah's wealth. As for His mercy and grace, which is vast and unlimited, it can be seen in the reality of the universe, His creation, and no one can deny it. In a hadith narrated from Abu Hurairah it is explained that the Messenger of Allah said: \"Allah divided His mercy into a hundred parts. So the ninety-nine parts He held at His side and one part He sent down to earth. From the mercy that one part that all creatures love, so that a horse will lift the soles of its feet for fear of being trampled by it. (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah) Allah, the Most Rich, the Most Extensive of His Mercy, forbids for Himself the nature of persecution, if Allah acts to inflict punishment on His ungodly servants then His actions are not contrary to these qualities . So with this verse Allah confirms to the enemies of the Prophet Muhammad that if Allah wills, He can definitely destroy them and replace them with other people that He has created just as He created them from other offspring. Allah's promise was proven by the destruction of the enemies of the Prophet Muhammad in the Battle of Badr, so that in the end there were no more polytheists in Mecca. They were replaced by people who believed and were pious, struggling to exalt Allah's sentence with their souls and property. Even though in defending the truth they were forced to take up arms and enter the battlefield, in each battle they became exemplary in being polite in treating their enemies, so that western historians admit that there was no nation that did not conquer other nations with a full sense of justice. and affection like the Arabs who have converted to Islam."

The definition of \"people\" among Arabs is very deep, almost the same as the meaning of \"nation\" today. People who love their nation will feel obliged to defend it, if they slip from the rails of truth. In this speech it is imagined that the Prophet Muhammad really hoped for their awareness and for them to return to the right path. In this challenge there is also God's promise to the Muslims, that they will get a big victory against the misguided and unjust polytheists. What happened then, in accordance with Allah's promise, the polytheists were continually overcome by defeats so that the word of Allah was firmly established and polytheism was destroyed. This is proof that Allah's promises in the hereafter will also be fulfilled, because promises in this world were also made before the events occurred, both of which are related to future events.

They said, \"The first part is for Allah as our offering to get closer to Him. The second part is for the idols we worship which are also to draw closer to Allah.\" With such a division they have become lost, because the sacrifice is a form of worship and self-approach to the worshiped. Worshiping idols and statues is an act that common sense cannot accept, because statues are inanimate objects that cannot do anything, even these statues were made by them. This tradition is a religion that was made up by the leaders and leaders of the Arab nation at that time, to influence the common people so that they still glorify and glorify the leader as the guardian and keeper of the idols and as the people closest to him. . Thus, they can rule over the common people. Blackmailing them by ordering their people to serve them by sacrificing property to idols which they consider to have power over their lives and can bring favor or disaster to whoever they want. The first part, which is dedicated to Allah, is used to feed guests, children and the poor; while the second part which is reserved for idols is fully controlled by its keepers and caretakers. But because they have been mastered by covetousness and greed, the portion allocated to the idols may not be reduced or taken at all to be combined with the portion designated for God. On the other hand, the portion that is destined for Allah may be taken to be combined with the portion of idols, because Allah's portion is the right of the poor and people who really need food. While the part of idols is wholly the right of the rulers. That's the rule they set and how evil that rule. Apart from that, the decree is a deprivation of the rights of the poor and people who really need help. The bad aspects of their decisions are as follows: a. They have violated Allah's rights, because only Allah has the right to make provisions in matters of worship. b. They have associated partners with idols, even though only Allah has the right to be worshiped and to Him all worship must be offered. c. They prioritize the rights of idols rather than the rights of God. d. The decision is not based on common sense nor is it based on any previous guidelines or Shari'a, only based on lustful desires.

If the part that is reserved for Allah is scattered, then it is mixed with the part that is meant for idols, then what is scattered is combined for idols. Furthermore, if the water that is meant for the plants that are part of the idols flows to the plants that are part of Allah, then the plants that are part of the idols They made the plant part of the idol for God.

By itself it is contrary to the formation of a strong and strong community because the strength and stability of a community depends on the strength and strength of the families that make up the community. Their recommendation is only based on three things: First: Because of poverty or fear of poverty. This is explained by God in His Word: Do not kill your children because they are poor. It is We who provide sustenance for you and for them. (al-An'am\/6: 151) In another of His words: And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. It is We who provide sustenance for them and for you. Killing them is truly a great sin. (al-Isra'\/17: 31) Second: For fear of being embarrassed later. They kill their daughters by burying them alive, because when they grow up they may commit heinous and despicable acts, or be taken as captives and enslaved, or marry men who are not of equal or lower status. from the degree of his father. In this case Allah says: Whereas if one of them is given the news of (the birth of) a daughter, his face becomes black (bright red), and he is very angry. He hid from the crowd, because of the bad news that was delivered to him. Will he protect it with (bear) humiliation or will he sink it into the ground (alive)? Remember how bad (the decision) they made it. (an-Nahl\/16: 58-59) Third: Because they vowed to idols, that they would sacrifice their children to get closer to those idols. Or for other reasons, for example, when they have had a number of children, they will sacrifice one of them, as was done by Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet Muhammad when he swore that he would sacrifice Abdullah, the father of the Prophet Muhammad, if he was given ten children. Such is the recommendation of the polytheists who destroy their character and instincts as human beings who have feelings of love and affection for children, this noble character turns cruel. He did not hesitate to kill his own flesh and blood child. Thus they deceive their people so that they can no longer distinguish between good and bad, and which are the actual religious regulations that must be followed and implemented. If Allah had willed, surely Allah could have restrained them from this destructive act and they would not have done it.

Al-Bukhari narrates that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"If you want to know how foolish the Arab polytheists are, read verse 130 onwards from surahh al-An'am, up to verse 140.\" Indeed, there are several Muslim traditions that are the same as those of the Arab Jahiliyah, some of which have been corrected, replaced or reduced. This is according to history because there were Arabs who preserved some of the teachings of the Prophet Abraham. But because of the fatroh or long void, there are many deviations from the original.

Because it is Allah who creates, Allah is the one who gives, then Allah is also the one who has the right to forbid or make it lawful. If any of His servants forbids it, then he considers himself equal with Allah, and those who obey him have partnered with Allah and this is shirk that cannot be doubted. The purpose of forbidding food here is to make it unlawful to eat, if you eat it it is definitely a sin. As for prohibiting food for health reasons, prohibited by doctors or for other reasons that are harmful, it is not considered as shirk, because Allah has commanded us to stay away from danger. Then Allah ordered to give some of the crops at harvest time to the poor, relatives and orphans, to be grateful for the blessings Allah has bestowed upon humans. Ibn Mundzir, Abu Shaykh and Ibn Mardawaih narrated from Abi Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah interpreted the words of Allah: (al-An'am\/6: 141) as, \"give the rights of the poor from what falls from the stem.\" It means fall when harvested. In this case, Mujahid said, \"When you are harvesting and poor people come, then beat the stalk of the fruit you harvest and give them what falls from the stalk; when you have separated the seeds from the stalk, then give them some of it. When you have winnowed, cleaned and collected it and it is known how much the value of the crop is, then pay zakat.\" Maimun bin Mihran and Zaid bin al-A'sham narrated that the residents of the city of Medina, when they harvested the dates they brought the date stalks to the mosque, then they put them there, then the poor came, then they beat the date stalks and gave them dates falling from their stalks. According to Sa'id bin Jubair, this was in effect before the order of zakat was issued. The Arabs always gave some of their crops to feed animals, alms to orphans and the poor. This custom is preserved by Islam when imposing zakat obligations (in the second year of Hijri where zakat for agricultural products must be given or issued immediately as soon as they are harvested, without being suspended). Furthermore, Allah forbids overeating, because it is very dangerous for health and can cause various diseases that may endanger the soul. Allah, the Most Merciful to His servants, does not like His excessive servants."

There are also animals with small bodies and short legs, such as sheep and rabbits, for their meat to be eaten, their fur woven into clothing and their skins used to make mats or footwear, and so on. Thus it can be understood how Allah's love for His servants He completes all human needs with plants and animals and even makes everything in the heavens and on earth for the benefit of His creatures, as stated in His word: Do you not see that Allah has subjected what is in the heavens and what is in the earth to your (interest) and perfected His favors for you physically and mentally. But among humans there are those who argue about (the oneness) of Allah without knowledge or guidance and without a book that gives light. (Luqman\/31: 20) Then Allah orders His servants to eat the sustenance that He has bestowed, but never follow Satan's steps, either from jinn or from humans. Leaders and guardians of idols act arbitrarily by making up rules and justifying and forbidding the favors of Allah which are bestowed upon His servants at will, without any instructions or orders from God. In fact, Satan is the most real enemy to humans, whose work is to mislead God's servants on earth."

What Allah has forbidden only two male tails? Or the child that is conceived by the sheep and the she-goats?

They have forbidden some of the animals that are lawful by Allah to be eaten, with reasons that are not true and by way of lying to Allah. So to cancel their reasons and reveal their lies, these questions were asked. If they forbid only the males of the four kinds of animals, of course all male animals and sheep, goats, camels and cows are unclean to eat. If it was only the females that were forbidden, of course all the females of the four types of animals were also unclean to eat. And if it is forbidden for all the children of the four kinds of animals, where else are they allowed to eat, because all the animals that will be born later are the children of that woman. In short, none of the four types of animals are forbidden by Allah. So the issue of forbidding some of the animals is only the act of the polytheists. Then, with even sharper words, Allah ordered His Messenger to ask them a question, namely, \"Have you seen for yourself that Allah ordered you to prohibit the animal?\" Surely they will not be able to answer this question, because they have forbidden some of the animals, simply because they followed demons and their leaders or because they found their fathers and forefathers had forbidden them, as stated in the word of Allah: And when they do abominable deeds, they said, \"We found our ancestors doing this, and Allah told us to do it.\" Say, \"Surely Allah never orders to do abomination.\" (al-A'raf\/7: 28) At the end of this verse Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to say to them, \"Why do you say that Allah has ordained something, when you yourself know it was not from Allah. After it was proven that they could not answered that question and could not put forward any real evidence to justify their attitudes and actions and it turned out that they only made up regulations to make things lawful and forbidden and even they lied to Allah by saying that these decrees were from Allah, then Allah confirms that they are a people who are unjust, and lie against Allah to mislead people from the right path. As a result of their mistake to deliberately go astray and mislead people, Allah will not guide them and later in the hereafter they will receive a reward that is appropriate in the form of a very painful torment in hell Hell."

Animals that die without being slaughtered in accordance with Shari'a regulations, including animals that die without being slaughtered, animals that die by suffocation, being beaten, falling, and so on. 2. Blood that flows or comes out of the body of an animal that is slaughtered or because of a wound, and so on. Excluding blood that does not flow such as liver, spleen and residual blood attached to the flesh. This provision is mentioned, among other things, in a hadith: It means: \"It is lawful for us to have two kinds of carrion, namely fish carcasses and locust carcasses, and two kinds of blood are also lawful, namely liver and spleen.\" (History of Ahmad and Ibn Majah from Ibn 'Umar) 3. Pork meat and all parts of its body including hair, skin, bones, milk and fat. 4. Animals that are slaughtered without mentioning the name of Allah, such as being slaughtered by mentioning the name of an idol or other object besides Allah. People who are forced to eat this food because they are very hungry and have no other food, while they don't want it nor do they exceed their limits, they may eat it simply to relieve their hunger and protect themselves from death. Apart from the forbidden foods above, in the hadith there are many kinds of animals that are prohibited from eating them, as contained in the hadith narrated from Ibn Abi Syaibah and al-Bukhari from Ibn 'Umar that he said: \"The Prophet forbade eating meat domesticated donkeys at the battle of khaibar\".

What made food forbidden for them was not the Prophet Muhammad's law, but all that was forbidden according to their law. The Prophet only narrated through revelation from Allah (Al-Qur'an). Thus it can be said that the Qur'an was not the work of Muhammad, but a revelation from Allah that was conveyed to him. Because the Prophet Muhammad himself could not have known such things, because he did not know how to read and write, while the polytheists of Mecca did not know these things either.

According to Mujahid and as-Suddy, this verse is addressed to the Jews, and according to some commentators it is addressed to the polytheists of Mecca, because this surahh al-An'am is a Makkiyah surahh. According to the first opinion, the meaning of this verse is as follows: If the Jews belie you, O Muhammad, because they deny that the Shari'ah was revealed to those who forbid some food as a reward and punishment for their disobedience, then tell them that although Allah is All-Wise His mercy and Most Merciful towards His servants, but this does not conflict with His wisdom because He as the Almighty, the Most Wise and the Most Just will still impose His torment and recompense on those who are unjust and disobedient. Inflicting torture on people who disobey and disobey can be seen as an act of compassion, because then the guilty person will realize his mistake and return to the right. And maybe also as a lesson for anyone so they don't commit injustice like the person who has been afflicted by Allah's punishment. According to the second opinion, where this verse is addressed to the polytheists of Mecca, the meaning is as follows: If the polytheists lie to you about their error, they forbid and make things lawful, tell them that your Lord is Most Compassionate and His mercy is extensive, therefore He does not reluctant to inflict His punishment on earth on you for that error and error. So don't be deceived because it's just a temporary suspension, not because He won't torture you. This is a harsh threat to them if they continue to be rebellious and continue to invent lies against Allah by forbidding what Allah has made lawful, but hope is still given to them that they will be forgiven with His mercy and compassion if they stop their disobedience and repent and believe in Him and in His Messenger. Thus they will be happy in this world by enjoying what He has made lawful and also happy in the hereafter by avoiding going to hell and going to heaven which He has prepared for those who believe."

It was Allah who wanted them to forbid shaibah and bahirah and Allah was pleased with the provisions they set. Yet Allah is free from all these accusations. Things like this are in the word of Allah: And the polytheists said, \"If Allah had willed, we would not have worshiped anything other than Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor had we forbidden anything without (permission) -His.\" That's what people before them did. Wasn't the duty of the apostles just to convey (the message of Allah) clearly.

			"tafsir": "At the beginning of this verse, Allah commands the Prophet Muhammad to tell the polytheists who determine the law according to their desires that he will read the revelation that Allah will send down to him. The revelation contains several provisions regarding things that are forbidden to them. The legal provisions come from Allah, so those provisions must be obeyed, because He alone has the right to determine legal provisions through the medium of revelations conveyed by angels to His Messengers, who were indeed sent to convey legal provisions to mankind. . The legal provisions conveyed by the Apostle to the polytheists contain 10 very important main teachings which are the core of the religion of Islam and all religions revealed by Allah to the world. Five provisions out of the ten provisions are contained in this ayat, four of which are contained in the next ayat (152), while one more provision is contained in the next ayat (153). The scholars named the ten main teachings \"al-Washaya al-'Ashr\" (ten commandments), of which five are mentioned in verse 151, namely: (1) Do not associate partners with Allah, (2) Do good to both parents (mother and father). ), (3) Don't kill children because of poverty, (4) Don't approach (do) evil openly or secretly, (5) Don't kill a soul that God has forbidden to kill him. As for the prohibition against associating partners with Allah, this is the most absolute first point, either in word or in intention. Such as believing that God is partnered with, or with actions such as worshiping idols or other gods. After Allah ordered people to believe in monotheism and not associate partners with Him, then Allah ordered people to do good to both parents. This sequence clearly explains how important it is to do good to both parents, even if they are wrong or order their children to associate partners with God, but the child must still do good to them in this world and must politely refuse orders or invitations from parents to associate partners with God, as Allah says: And if both of them force you to associate with Me with something that you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them both, and get along well with both of them in this world. (Luqman\/31: 15) In the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abdullah bin Mas'ud. He conveyed a hadith whose meaning was as follows: \"I asked the Messenger of Allah, about the most afdal deed?\" Rasulullah replied, \"praying on time,\" what else after that? The answer, \"do good to both parents,\" what else after that? The answer, \"jihad in the way of Allah.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) What is meant by doing good to both parents is respecting both, both in words and in deeds full of love and affection, not out of fear or compulsion. This respect is mandatory, in addition to the child's obligation to pay for his parents who cannot afford it, according to the child's ability. The command to do good to parents is followed by a prohibition on parents killing their children because of poverty that befalls them, because God will provide sustenance for them and their children. God's Word: And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. It is We who provide sustenance for them and for you. Killing them is truly a great sin. (al-Isra'\/17: 31) The prohibition on killing children in this verse is different from the prohibition on killing children in another verse (in surahh al-Isra' verse 31). In verse 151 of surahh al-An'am, the prohibition against killing children for fear of poverty that is being suffered (overwrites). In this verse it is explained that Allah will provide sustenance to parents who provide for their children, and the word means that Allah will provide sustenance to them (your children). Meanwhile, in surahh al-Isra', Allah explains that the verse means \"We will provide sustenance for them (children)\" and the word means \"Allah will provide sustenance for you (parents). The priority of children in providing sustenance shows Allah's concern that is so great for children, due to the attitude of parents who are afraid to have children because they are afraid of becoming poor.In this verse Allah forbids approaching abominable acts let alone doing them, whether in the form of acts, such as adultery, or accusing someone of adultery, whether the act is done clearly -overtly or in secret. It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas in interpreting this verse, during the Jahiliyah period that people did not view it as evil committing adultery in secret, but they viewed it as evil if it was done openly. So with this verse Allah forbids adultery openly -overt or hidden Another opinion says that what is meant by visible (bright) actions are all things actions with the limbs, while what is hidden are the actions of the heart, such as arrogance, jealousy, and so on. In this verse, God also prohibits killing souls without a just cause according to God's teachings. The Messenger of Allah said: \"It is not permissible to kill the soul of a Muslim, unless it is caused by one of three things, namely: for apostasy (a Muslim who turns into an infidel), adultery, muhsan (adultery of a person who has ever been married) and killing people without a just cause. \" (History of Abu Dawud). Likewise, those who disbelieve who have a peace agreement with the Muslims cannot be killed or disturbed, in accordance with the words of the Prophet: \"They have rights as we (Muslims) have rights and have obligations as we (Muslims) have.\" ).\" (History of At-Tirmidhi) After explaining five of the very important main teachings, Allah ends this verse with an affirmation which means: That is what God has commanded you, so that you understand its purpose not like your actions which justify and forbid something according to your desires. ."

The wills are : (6) Do not approach the property of orphans, except in a more beneficial way. (7\/8) The need to perfect measures and scales. (9) Act fairly in words, even towards the family. (10) Fulfilling God's promise. As for the prohibition to approach the assets of orphans, that is, no one may approach, use or make use of the assets of orphans, either from the guardian or from other parties, unless the approach is aimed at maintaining and developing the assets of the orphan. If the orphan is an adult then the property will be handed over to him. Regarding age, the scholars stated that it was around 15-18 years or by looking at the situation and condition of the child, considering that maturity is not only based on age but on emotional maturity and responsibility so that they can maintain and develop their assets and not spend or waste their inheritance. Regarding the need to perfect measures and weights, this command is repeatedly mentioned in several surahhs in the Qur'an in various ways, forms and relationships with various issues, including the word of Allah: And perfect the measure when you measure, and weigh it with the correct scales. That is more important (to you) and better as a result. (al-Isra'\/17: 35) God's command to perfect measures and weights is only according to ability which is usually carried out in this matter, because God does not burden His servants but only his ability. The important thing is there is no element or intention of fraud. What is meant by having to speak fairly even towards the family is every word, especially in giving testimony and legal decisions. And this is very important for every development, especially in the moral and social fields, without distinguishing other people from relatives. This has also been explained in the word of Allah: Allah promises those who believe and do good among them, forgiveness and a great reward. (al-Fath\/48: 29) As for what is meant by Allah's promises, they are all good promises to God as Allah says: Have I not commanded you, O son of Adam, so that you do not worship Satan? Indeed, satan is a real enemy for you. (Yasin\/36: 60) Another Word of God: And those who keep their promises when they promise. (al-Baqarah\/2: 177) This verse ends with the phrase \"hope you remember\", because all the commands or prohibitions mentioned in this verse are generally known and carried out by the Jahiliyah Arabs, they are even proud because they have praiseworthy qualities That.

National fanatics (hereditary clans), because every nation and ethnic group (race) does not like being dominated by others. 3. Fanatical sects and opinions about the main religion and its branches. 4. Religious fatwas according to thoughts and tastes only. Because of this many people dare to give fatwas in Islam, even though they have not been able to take a law from the Qur'an and hadith. 5. Efforts and deceit to divide groups of enemies of Islam, so that many maudhu' (fake) hadiths are caused by those who can influence the ummah (Islamic leaders) to use them as arguments for the religion of Islam."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is clearly explained that whoever does good deeds, Allah will reward him in the Hereafter with ten times his deeds. Whoever commits evil is only recompensed according to his crime, because Allah will not wrong them in the slightest or harm them. What is meant by people who do good deeds here are believers, because the good deeds of disbelievers before converting to Islam will not benefit them in the hereafter, as explained in the word of Allah: That is Allah's guidance, with which He guides whom only among His servants whom He wills. If they had associated partners with Allah, their deeds would have vanished. (al-An'am\/6: 88) The meaning of the phrase \"ten times the reward\" here does not include what Allah promised with a much more and multiplied reward to those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah up to 700 times fold. If you lend to Allah with a good loan, He will surely multiply (reply) to you and forgive you. And Allah is most grateful, most forbearing. (at-Tagabun\/64: 17) In the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad, many are found about the reward for good deeds and bad deeds. It is even explained that the reward for someone who has not done a good deed, but only the intention or determination to melt it. This is stated in a hadith qudsi narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah which tells the following: Verily the Messenger of Allah said, \"Allah said, \"If My servant wants to do good and does not do it, then write for him a reward of virtue. And if he does it, then write down ten to seven hundred times the reward of goodness. And if My servant wants to do an evil job, don't write it down (don't write it down) as a mistake before doing it. And when he does it, write down for him one mistake (crime). \" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Verily the Messenger of Allah said, \"Allah said to His angels, if My servant wants to do an evil job, do not write it down (do not record it) as a mistake before doing it. And when he does it, record for him one mistakes (crimes). And if he left (did not do it) because of Me (because of Allah), then write for him a good deed. And if he wants to do good and does not do it, then write for him a reward of virtue. And if he does, then write down until seven hundred times the reward of goodness for him.\""

That is the religion of Abraham, not other religions that contain shirk, which people always attribute to it incorrectly, because Abraham was not a polytheist. This verse at the same time refutes the belief of the Meccan Arabs, that angels are daughters of Allah, and refutes the Jews who say that Uzair is the son of Allah and the Christians who say that Isa is the son of Allah. Each said that the religion they professed was the religion of Abraham, even though they had deviated from the religion of Abraham."

That's what he was told. The apostle is the person who first submits himself to Allah in following and obeying all of His commands and prohibitions. These two verses contain Allah's teachings to Muhammad, which must be conveyed to his people, how a Muslim should live and live in this world. All prayers and other acts of worship must be carried out diligently and wholeheartedly for the sake of Allah, with sincerity and no strings attached. A Muslim must believe in the nature and iradat of Allah who has no partner for Him. Allah is the one who determines a person's life and death. Therefore a Muslim does not need to be afraid of death in jihad in the way of Allah and there is no need to be afraid of losing his position in conveying Islamic da'wah, amar ma'ruf nahi munkar. This verse is always read in the prayer after takbiratul ihram as an iftitah prayer except for the word: replaced by (164) needs of his life so that He helps him or protects him from distress and danger? Glory be to Allah from that fellowship. He is the Lord of all things, it is He who created the universe. Furthermore, in this verse it is explained that all human actions will be accounted for by themselves, and those who commit sins will bear their own sins, because someone else's sins will not be borne by others. Each receives the reward of his good deeds and bears the sins of his bad deeds. This is repeatedly mentioned in the Qur'an. Allah's Word: (Namely) that a person who sins will not bear the sins of others, and that man only gets what he has worked for. (an-Najm\/53: 38-39) This verse is sufficient to provide guidance and a way of life that is of high quality and practical, because in addition to having to do charity and work one must also carefully and thoroughly calculate every deed one does. Because the charity work or deed is very influential in bringing one's luck and downfall, both in this world and in the hereafter. In the afterlife, human disputes in religion will be resolved."

			"tafsir": "If we go back to examining this surahh of the Qur'an in its entirety, then we will be able to conclude that this life and life has been highlighted by the light of guidance from all directions, because in it explained matters of faith or belief and their arguments, The Apostle has conveyed Allah's commands through revelation to refute disobedient disbelievers, in matters of the resurrection of the hereafter and al-jaza' (reward to charity), regarding the relationship between humans and their Creator, the relationship between humans and fellow human beings, especially in doing good to both mothers. father, about conflicts in religion, deeds and others. From the historical reality of all time, it is proven that humans are still humans, past and present there has always been hostility even though fellow brothers and fellow human beings, then one can also feel the connection and wisdom at the end of this verse, \"And it is He who made you caliphs on earth and He elevates (degrees) some of you above others, to test you for the (gifts) He has given you. Verily, your Lord is very quick to punish and indeed, He is Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" This verse seems to say, in fact your Lord is the one who created all things, He is the one who made you the rulers of this earth and He has exalted some of you in rank over others, both in position and wealth as well as intelligence and so on, because He wants to test you with what he has given you. Verily, your Lord is quick to punish Him and verily, He is Most Forgiving to those who truly seek forgiveness from Him and Most Merciful to His believing servants. This verse emphasizes that it is Allah who has made humans the rulers on earth to regulate the lives of their people and it is He who exalts some of them over others. All of that is according to sunatullah to test each of them how they respond to God's gift that God has given him. They will get a reward from that test, both in this world and in the hereafter. Rulers are tested for justice and honesty, the rich are tested how he spends his wealth, the poor and the sufferer are tested for their patience. Therefore, humans should not be jealous and envious of God's gifts to someone, because all that is from God and all His gifts are a test for everyone."
