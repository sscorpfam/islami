This is evening time, that is, when the red light has disappeared on the western horizon. At that time, humans generally have ended their activities, and want to rest and go to sleep. Then Allah swears by nature's activities on the contrary, namely during the day when it is bright. It was the time of Duha when the sunlight was evenly shining on this nature, which contrasted with the night that had just ended, and humans started working."

He does not only issue zakat on his wealth, which is an obligation, but also spends, gives alms, and so on which is not obligatory. Second, piety, namely fear of ignoring His commands or violating His prohibitions. Third, justifying God's goodness, namely acknowledging the blessings that have been given to him and then being grateful for them. God's greatest favor that he acknowledged was heaven. Therefore, he does not hesitate to do good in the world to get it, including helping fellow human beings. For those who do the three aspects of good deeds above, Allah will make it easy for them, namely the ease to get good luck in this world and in the hereafter."

Difficulties in the afterlife are torments whose peak is hell. Humans, if they die without having charity and then go to hell in the hereafter, then their property and wealth will be of no use whatsoever. That's because the treasure will not be used to atone for their sins."
