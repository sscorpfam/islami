			"tafsir": "The first verse of sura Yunus sounds the same as the first verse of surah Yunus except that at the end of the first verse of sura Yunus there is the word \"al-hakim\" while in the first verse of this surah there is the word \"al-Mubin\". Al-hakim means full of wisdom and al-Mubin means real, clear and bright. Usually, by paying attention to the first verse of each surah, one can already predict what the main contents of that surah are. surahh Yunus, whose first verse ends with al-Hakim, contains issues of wisdom and philosophy, such as the problem of the oneness of Allah, His attributes, the truth of the message brought by the prophets which is strengthened by various kinds of miracles, the problem of the day of resurrection, the day revenge, and so on. All of these are matters that must be contemplated and thought about deeply and include matters of wisdom and philosophy. As for surahh Yusuf, the first verse ends with al-Mubin. This suggests that in it there is a very interesting story, composed with an enchanting arrangement of words full of origins and philosophies in a beautiful storyline that encourages the reader to follow it to the end, a story that should be an example and a role model that illustrates it is clear how the life of a noble prophet since his childhood experienced various kinds of suffering until he became a respected and respected ruler in the land of Egypt."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah confirms that He sent down the Al-Quran in fluent Arabic so that one can contemplate and think about its content and meaning. Indeed, the Koran was revealed for all humans, even for jinns, but since the first to receive it were the residents of Mecca, it is only natural that the word was addressed first to them and then applies to all mankind. First of all, Allah demands the attention of the Quraysh and the Arabs as a whole so that they pay attention to its contents as well as possible because it contains various kinds of knowledge that will benefit them in this world and the hereafter such as religious laws, stories of the prophets. and apostles, matters related to community development, the principles of prosperity, morals, philosophy, political procedures, both national and international, and so on. All of this was explained in beautiful Arabic, the composition of which was easy for them to understand."

The commentators say that this sura Yusuf is one of the surahhs in the Koran which was sent down to comfort and rejoice the Prophet Muhammad when he was suffering from heavy pressure from the Quraysh in the form of ridicule, insults, defiance, and acts of violence so that he was forced to emigrated with Abu Bakr to Medina. This is indeed the case because the story of the Prophet Yusuf is a very interesting story, told in detail, each chapter contains deep wisdom and lessons that are of great benefit to those who pay attention to it, especially when viewed in terms of the beauty of the language structure and the contents of the story which are not yet known entirely by the Prophet Muhammad himself as well as by the Quraysh and Arabs in general. In addition to telling the story of the Prophet Jacob as and his children who are still living with the way of life of the Bedouin people, it also tells how life in a society that has developed and has a high culture, how the life of the rulers is full of luxury and pleasure and how they control the government and control the country's economy. It is true that the word of God says that the story of the Prophet Yusuf as which will be narrated below is the story of the best, most interesting, and the most beautiful depiction."

			"tafsir": "Once upon a time the Prophet Yusuf as told his father the Prophet Jacob bin Ishak bin Ibrahim that he dreamed of seeing eleven stars, the sun and the moon, all of them bowed down and prostrated to him. Of course, prostration here does not mean worship as we know it, but only prostrate in a figurative sense, namely submission and obedience. Prostration with the meaning of submission and obedience is also found in the Qur'an, as Allah says: And plants and trees, both are subject (to Him). (ar-Rahman\/55: 6) After hearing the story, the Prophet Jacob realized that his son's dream was not an ordinary dream, but an inspiration from Allah as often experienced by the prophets. He believes that this child will face very important matters and when he grows up he will become a leader to whom society will obey, including his siblings and parents. He was worried that his brothers and sisters would find out about this, and of course they would feel jealous and jealous of him and try to get rid of or destroy him, especially since they felt that their father was more affectionate towards him. It is illustrated in the visions of the Prophet Jacob how the fate of his son would have been if his brothers knew that dream, of course they would have harmed him with all their efforts and deceit."

I see that the dream was not just any dream. Your dream was an inspiration from Allah that you will later become a big and influential person, and humans will obey you including your brothers and I and your mother. I cannot guarantee that your brothers and sisters I won't do bad things to you.\" Joseph's father's advice was fully realized and he always remembered and remembered so that later at the end of the story when he was able to meet his entire family, he continued to say that it was Satan who deceived his brothers so that the connection between him and his family was cut off, as stated in the word of God: And he (Yusuf) said, â€œO my father! ) between me and my brothers. Truly, my Lord is All-gentle towards what He wills. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\" (Joseph\/12: 100)"

He will give you knowledge by inspiring it to you. With that knowledge you can veil dreams and know things that you cannot common man knows.\" This was proven when Joseph was in prison, able to foreshadow the dream of the king of Egypt so that he became a respected person and was appointed supreme ruler. Apart from that, you can find out what food will be brought by the prison staff before the food reaches his friend's room, as stated in the word of Allah in this surah as well. He (Yusuf) said, \"Whatever food will be given to you both, I have been able to explain the takwil, before (the food) reaches you. That is part of what God taught me.\" (Yusuf\/12: 37) Then Jacob said again to Joseph in this verse, \"God will perfect His favor and gift to you and to Jacob's family including your father, your brother, and their descendants later in the day. As for His favor and gift to you is as explained earlier, while His favor and gift to your father and mother and your brothers and their descendants is that they are released from various kinds of difficulties and dangers and get honor and position in Egypt, then among the descendants of Jacob's family will also be raised several prophets. All these blessings and gifts have been given by Allah to your grandfather Ibrahim and Isaac. To Abraham, Allah has promised to choose between his family and descendants to receive prophethood and the holy book.\" Jacob continued again, \"Thus the veil of the dream and be happy with the mercy and grace of God that will be bestowed on you, but you must be steadfast and patient in facing all its tests and full of trust and willing for everything that He inflicts on you, because He is All-Wise and All-Knowing. what He decreed.\""

Our father's attitude is contrary to justice and equal rights between children. Why did you give priority to these two weak and helpless children over us who are strong and more able to serve and be devoted to them?\" At a glance, it is clear that the truth of the words of Yusuf's brothers was clear, as if the Prophet Jacob had made a mistake with his actions even though he was a prophet who was always guided by Allah in all his attitudes and actions. According to history, Jacob really paid great attention to Joseph, because there were hunches and signs that indicated that Joseph had special traits and characteristics. This privilege is not owned by his other brothers. So Jacob really put his hope in him, especially after he heard Joseph tell his dream. If Jacob loves Yusuf more and pays more attention to him, then this is natural, because Yusuf and Bunyamin are still small and need more attention and guidance from their parents than their older siblings. It was only jealousy and jealousy that prompted his brothers to commit acts of hostility against him, not because their father had deviated from the path of justice."

Thus, their father Jacob would give up and have no hope of meeting his son who he loved the most, and over time, of course, he would forget about it. So far, the only thing that had prevented him from paying attention to them was Yusuf by his side. If Joseph was gone or exiled to a far country, surely their father would come back to care for and love them. They realized that this action was an act that was cruel and inhuman, a criminal act that was very sinful. However, they have strayed far from the right path and fallen into Satan's snares, so that they no longer see the consequences of their actions for their fathers and themselves if they are committed. They persuade themselves that, even though they have sinned, the door to repentance is still wide open. They will repent with nasuha repentance and will not do that again, and become pious servants of God. Of course Allah will accept repentance, forgive all the sins and mistakes of His servants, thus their father will be pleased with them, and Allah will not torture them."

Why do we have to commit murder to achieve that goal, commit a grave sin that God will not necessarily forgive? He has a not so serious suggestion of sin, namely to drop Joseph into a well and later he will be found by travelers and will be taken to a distant land. Thus, Joseph will not die and they are free from the sin of murder while the aims and objectives are achieved as well.

In this verse it is explained that when they arrived at a place where there was a well they executed their evil plot, and put Yusuf into the well. Thus, they feel very happy because the scourge that has been haunting their souls is no longer there. They thought it was Joseph who had stolen his father's affections and now that he was gone Jacob's affections would surely spill over to them. What about Joseph himself who had been languishing in that dark well? Of course he was very sad and imagined in his mind that he would die of cold and hunger and would never meet his parents and siblings again. At that very critical moment, Allah inspired him so that he should not worry and not be sad. Allah will take care of him and deliver him from the harm that befell him.

It was a very lively party. Laughter shouted back and forth, talk and jokes became rampant. Various kinds of food are served unbroken. So are drinks. Finally, fruits were served. To each present was given a knife to peel the fruit. At that time, the minister's wife who was the hostess, ordered Yusuf to come out to the midst of the guests who were sitting relaxing cutting fruit to introduce herself. So Joseph came out and stood before the guests. The women had just seen Joseph's face, which was as beautiful as the full moon. Unknowingly, the knife in their hand, they cut into their own hands and fingers, not to cut the fruit and they don't feel the pain. From their mouths came the words, \"Glory to God, he is not a human, but a glorious angel.\" So amazed and amazed they saw Joseph who was very charming and thrilled them, this was the figure of the person they talked about everyday by blaming and ridiculing the minister's wife."

Now you are all fascinated looking at him. Just a cursory glance at him. , you have forgotten yourself. Look, you have cut your finger because you are fascinated looking at Yusuf.\" Al-Aziz's wife said, \"I admit it frankly, it was I who had fallen in love with him and it was I who seduced him and invited him to be dishonest. But he was still reluctant and took refuge in his Lord. He turned away and distanced himself from me. I continued to tease him and seduce him until he wants to follow the desires of my lust. If he also doesn't want to, I will tell my husband, so he is put in prison and of course he will be a despicable person. My husband does not dare to refuse my suggestion and my husband will punish him according to my wishes. \" He deliberately said those words in front of the guests at the festive banquet, so that Joseph himself would hear them and so that the guests could soften Joseph's heart. It is better to obey whatever al-Aziz's wife wants than to get angry and end up in prison, living together with bad and despicable people. If Joseph wants to follow his will, of course Joseph will be lucky that all the wealth and luxuries of the contents of the palace can also be controlled by Yusuf. In short, everyone present at that time had sided with al-Aziz's wife, no longer blaming and mocking her. Everyone agreed that the minister's wife should have been tempted and infatuated by Yusuf, who lived in her house. So all the women helped persuade Yusuf to comply with the minister's wife's wish, without being shy and timid."

Allah's intention to grant Yusuf's prayer to go to prison was different from that of the magnate (al-Aziz). God's purpose was for Joseph to remain clean, protected from all temptations that polluted his soul. Also so that Joseph would be patient and endure suffering in prison, associating with people who had been in prison for a long time with various characters, behaviors, and temperaments. Because Joseph will be appointed by God to be a prophet to his people. Prison is the place where he grew up and the place where Allah first revealed his revelation to him.

Such a thing was not only clearly known by the minister and his wife, but also by the entire royal family. Even so, Joseph was still put in prison for an indefinite period of time as the implementation of his wife's request, so that the people thought that Joseph was guilty, even though his wife was guilty.

We don't know what our dream means.\" Yusuf said to the two of them, \"Only Allah knows the tafsir of your dreams, try to tell me what your dreams are.\" So one of the two told me about his dream and he said, \"I dreamed that I was in a vineyard which was very dense with fruit and green in color.

When they entered, Yusuf knew that those who had come were his own brothers, because their appearance and type of clothing still stuck in his memory, especially since there were ten of them.

The ruler replied that if it was true that they had relatives, they should be brought to Egypt. The ruler will again give them as much food as requested. They were warned that if Bunyamin could not be taken, they could not come back to Egypt, and would not be given food, because they were considered liars who were not worthy of being trusted. Therefore, they begged Jacob earnestly to allow Benjamin to go with them. In this way, they would be given food and received a better welcome because they had fulfilled their promise to bring Bunyamin to Egypt. They promised to take good care of Bunyamin."

According to the world of science, when a person suffers from stress, his body reacts and raises alarm signals, thereby triggering various biochemical reactions in the body: Adrenaline levels in the bloodstream increase; energy use and body reactions reach their highest point; sugar, cholesterol and fatty acids are channeled into the bloodstream; blood pressure rises and the pulse accelerates. When glucose is delivered to the brain, cholesterol levels rise, and all this creates problems for the body. Perhaps this was also experienced by the Prophet Yaqub as when he lost his beloved child Prophet Yusuf as Severe stress was able to affect and even change the normal functions of the organs of the body. This can have dire consequences. As a result of stress, adrenaline and cortisol levels in the body increase above normal levels. Increased cortisol levels over a long period of time lead to organ disorders, including disorders of the pancreas. As a result, diabetes or diabetes arises, namely the destruction of pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin, resulting in uncontrolled blood sugar levels in the body. In many cases, diabetes can cause symptoms of cataracts, namely clouding of the eye lens which causes blurred vision. If the lens becomes cloudy, the light that enters the eye can be scattered and cause blurred vision. Medical (eye) experts agree that inadequate or poorly controlled treatment can cause blindness in people with this disease. The main symptoms of cataracts are blurred vision, progressively reduced vision, the presence of a thin membrane that blocks the view, very glare when exposed to bright light. In subsequent developments, vision gets worse, the pupils appear white (there are whites in the black of the eye). Today, this \"white eye\" (cataract) disease can be cured, especially with the advancement of current medical technology or because blood sugar levels can be controlled. well. Different of course with the Prophet Yaqub as whose recovery took place quickly, maybe because of a miracle for a Prophet or it could also be the fruit of his \"patience\".

Upon arrival, they told his parents about Joseph's position in Egypt, where he was the full authority there. It was also conveyed that Yusuf invited all his family to settle in Egypt together with him, enjoying the progress and beauty of the city of Egypt. Hearing the news, they went together to Egypt. After arriving in Egypt they met Yusuf and his entourage who went to pick them up in the middle of the road. Yusuf embraced his parents and said, \"Please enter the land of Egypt safely and securely, God willing, you will not experience difficulties and hunger, even though the dry season is still gripping.\" The words \"Insya Allah\" that Yusuf said are a lesson for us Muslims that if you want to do something, you must rely on Allah's will. This has become a custom for the prophets and shiddiqin. This is also in accordance with the intent of the word of Allah SWT: And do not ever say to something, \"I will definitely do that tomorrow morning,\" except (by saying), \"God willing.\" (al-Kahf\/18: 23 and 24)"

They lay down and bowed down to pay their respects to Joseph, as people usually pay respect to kings and princes at that time. Yusuf then said, \"O my father! This is the takbir of my first dream when I was a child which I conveyed to my father with the words: Indeed, I (dreamed) saw eleven stars, the sun and the moon; I saw them all prostrate to me. (Yusuf\/12: 4 ) Yusuf further said, \"Allah swt made my dream come true, not a fantasy. The eleven stars are my brothers, who number eleven people, while the sun and moon are my father and mother.\" It was with this family that Allah took care of the descendants of the Prophet Isaac, the son of Prophet Abraham, to develop the religion of monotheism on this earth. Furthermore, Yusuf said to his father, \"Allah swt has been good to me. He released me from prison and made me ruler. He moved his father from a desert village with a simple and rough life, to a bustling land, enjoying a happy life, spreading true religion, and helping in advancing science. This all happened after Satan cut off the friendly relations between my brothers and I so that brotherly relations were damaged, and jealousy and suspicion arose between us. Verily, Allah swt is All-Knowing of everything, however subtle, is gentle to His servants, and determines what He wills with His wisdom. Verily, He is All-Knowing of what is of benefit to His servants. Nothing is hidden from Him. Wise in all things, repays those who do good with good, and a good end is given to those who are pious.\""

(Luqman\/31: 25) The Meccan Quraysh's acknowledgment of Allah's existence was also followed by associating partners with Him. They worship idols and make priests as gods. In fact, some of them even say that God has a son. Glory be to Allah swt from what was alleged. Associating partners with Allah is the greatest sin. Ibn Masud once asked the Prophet Muhammad about the greatest sin. The Prophet replied: That you have partnered with Allah, even though He created you.

Do they feel safe that they will not meet sudden and unexpected death? Never! At any time Allah swt could inflict punishment on them, so Allah swt could order the Angel Azrael to take his life suddenly and unexpectedly if Allah wills. Allah SWT is the Executor of what He wills, as His word: Indeed, your Lord is the Executor of what He wills. (Hud\/11: 107) In line with this verse 107, the word of Allah swt: So do those who make that evil deception feel safe (from disaster) that Allah immerses the earth with them, or (against) punishment comes to them from directions they are not aware of, or Allah punishes them while they are on their way; so that they are powerless to resist (the doom), or Allah will punish them gradually (until they perish). So verily, your Lord is Most Gracious, Most Merciful. (an-Nahl\/16: 45-47) Among the wisdom of hiding when doom appears to be suddenly or the sudden taking of life by Azrael, is so that they are always ready for death. Thus, they are always obedient and obedient in carrying out worship and do not commit immorality. They are aware only of Allah swt humans worship and do not associate partners with Him in the least."

That is the duty and obligation of those who believe in and follow it so that all kinds of servitude to other than Allah can be eradicated from the surface of this earth. Pay attention to the word of Allah SWT which teaches how to preach to the Messenger and his people: Call (people) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good teaching.

The heavens and the earth and all that is in them, even all that exists, glorify Allah to purify Allah from such things, says Allah SWT: The seven heavens, the earth and all that is in them glorify Allah.

This is a response to the accusations leveled by people who deny the prophethood of Muhammad saw, who wanted the messengers sent to be from the type of angels as narrated by Allah in His words: And had Allah willed, He would have sent angels. (al-Muminun\/23: 24) Wouldn't the polytheists of Quraysh deny the prophethood of Muhammad and deny what he brought as oneness of Allah, sincere worship solely to Him, traveling the earth and seeing and witnessing the consequences of people -those who denied the first apostles. They were annihilated and their country destroyed, as experienced by the Prophet Hud, the Prophet Saleh, and others. On the other hand, those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and are afraid of associating partners with Allah, do not commit sins and immorality, will find pleasure later in the hereafter which is far better than what the polytheists in this world get. Do they not think about the difference in reward and reward between those who deny and those who believe. The pleasures that the deniers get in the world are very limited. When they die, the fun will end, and in the afterlife they will receive a very painful punishment without stopping. And the pleasure that believers get, not only in this world but in the hereafter, because the pleasure they get is eternal forever."

After the apostles were opposed, belied, and despised by their people so that they felt very heavy pressure, a feeling arose as if they were hopeless because there was no hope for their people to believe and the victory they had been waiting for had not yet come, that was when help Allah swt is coming. Meanwhile, those who denied the prophets were subject to sudden punishment, such as the great flood that drowned the people of Prophet Noah, the hurricane that destroyed the people of Ã‚'d (the people of Prophet Hud), the torment that befell the Samud people, and the disaster that hit the land of the The Prophet Lut, as stated in the word of Allah swt: Did not news reach them (about) those who were before them, (namely) the people of Nuh, Ad, Samud, the people of Abraham, the people of Madyan, and (the people of) the countries that been destroyed? The apostles had come to them with clear proofs; Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. (at-Taubah\/9: 70) Those of Quraysh who do not want to convert and return to the right path, even though clear evidence has been shown, Allah will inflict a painful punishment on them. Meanwhile, the Prophet Muhammad was given assistance in the form of various victories he had obtained such as the Battle of Badr and in the following wars. Allah swt saved the apostles and their people who believe in Him, while those who disbelieve in Allah and deny His messengers and the religion they carry will be punished, none of them can refuse and avoid Allah's punishment ."

While people who are negligent who do not use their minds and minds to understand the existing reality, then the story of the Prophet will not be of any use to him.

The holy book Al-Quran which carries these stories, is not a story that is made up and made up, but is a revelation sent down by Allah swt and a miracle that weakens accomplished literary figures when challenged to compile something like that. The stories were reported from the prophet who never studied books and never associated with clever scholars. Even the Holy Koran confirms the contents of heavenly books that were revealed to previous prophets, such as the original Torah, Bible and Psalms, of course, not those that have been added to superstitions and other things whose purity is no longer maintained. In the holy book Al-Quran, Allah's commands are clearly described, His prohibitions, His promises and threats, the nature of perfection that is obligatory for Him and is holy from the characteristics of deficiencies and other things, as the word of Allah swt: We have omitted nothing in the Book.
