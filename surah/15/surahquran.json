It is the most complete book among the books that Allah sent down to His apostles, justifying the previous book, and explaining the way to happiness and the wrong path that the previous peoples had taken. Thus, humans can distinguish between the two paths, which one to follow and which one to avoid and shun. In the Al-Qur'an there are also verses that explain monotheism, stories, good manners, science, Allah's promises and His threats, and laws that guide human life and life in this world and in in order to achieve safety and happiness in the hereafter, as the word of Allah swt: Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book whose verses are neatly arranged and then explained in detail, (which was revealed) from (Allah) Who is All-Wise, All-Knowing. (Hud\/11: 1) And the word of Allah swt: Alif Lam Mim shad. (This is) the Book that was sent down to you (Muhammad); so do not be short of breath over it, so that you may warn with it (the Book) and become a lesson for those who believe. (al-A'raf\/7: 1-2)"

			"tafsir": "This verse is a warning from Allah SWT to disbelievers by explaining to them that in the hereafter when they feel the severity of the torments of hell, they will regret their actions and actions of denying God Almighty while living in this world. If they had followed the messenger's call, carried out Allah's commandments, abandoned His prohibitions, and worshiped submissively and obediently to Him, surely they would not have been punished as they experienced on that day. If they had done otherwise, Allah would have entered them into a paradise full of pleasures as experienced by the Muslims at that time. But at that time, all their regrets would be of no use. Allah swt has determined His decisions that cannot be changed anymore, unless His power wants something else. In a hadith, the moments of their regret are explained: From Abu Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, he said, \"The Messenger of Allah said, \"When the inhabitants of hell have gathered together with them, there are people whom Allah wills from the qibla experts (believers), people infidels said to the Muslims, \"Didn't you all used to be Muslims.\" The Muslims say, \"That's right.\" They said, \"It does not benefit you the religion of Islam that you professed before, so that you are gathered with us in this hell?\" The Muslims say, \"We have committed a sinful act, so we are punished for it.\" So Allah swt heard their conversation, then ordered the Muslims who were in hell to be expelled. When the remaining unbelievers saw this, they said, \"O if we were Muslims, we would also be expelled from hell, just as they were expelled.\" Abu Musa Said, \"Then the Messenger of Allah said, \"I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil.\" And then he recited this verse.\" (History of ath-thabrani) The word of Allah swt which is in line with this verse is: And if you (Muhammad) see when they are brought to hell, they say, \"If we were returned (to the world) we certainly would not deny the verses of our Lord , and become people of faith.\" (al-An'am\/6: 27) As mentioned in al-Maragi, Az-Zajjaj said, \"Indeed, the disbelievers, when they see the state of the punishment of hell and see the condition of the Muslims in heaven, they wish, if in the past their world is Muslim people.\" Thus Allah describes the character of humans who deny Allah. They only remember Allah when the danger and punishment befalls them, but when the danger and punishment is gone, they turn back to deny Allah, their helper and creator. Things like that also happen to disbelievers who dream of returning to live in the world to worship and they promise that if their wish is granted, they will truly believe that they will not deny again as before. If humans really want to believe, then Allah SWT's instructions are sufficient which are conveyed by His prophets and messengers, but most humans are affected by the pleasures of worldly life which are temporary in nature. They serve themselves more to the accursed satan than to serve themselves to Allah, the God who created them. There have been enough opportunities to repent that God gave them while on earth, but they ignored the opportunity. Once they are in the afterlife, that opportunity will not be given again. For them, Allah's provisions have been applied which will punish everyone who disbelieves in Him. This verse is a strong warning to Arab polytheists in particular, and disbelievers in general, especially those who prevent the spread of Allah's religion on earth. For the Prophet and his companions, this verse is good news. At the time of the revelation of this verse, the disbelievers severely hindered the implementation of the Islamic da'wah that was being carried out by the Prophet and his companions, even the polytheists of Mecca had reached the level of carrying out acts of persecution accompanied by harsh threats to the followers of the Prophet Muhammad, so that the Prophet and his companions almost despair and worry, if the task that God bears cannot be carried out properly. The revelation of this verse creates a sense of optimism. Their steadfastness and patience increase in spreading Allah's religion because they really believe that Islam will definitely develop and the most essential victory is the victory that will be obtained in the afterlife. From this verse and the hadith above, it can be understood that the reward or punishment that will be received by those who believe and those who disbelieve is appropriate and in accordance with the deeds they have done while in the world."

What is meant by reason is that an apostle was sent to the people to convey Allah's religion, but they rejected the apostle or denied his teachings.

In fact, your words and preaching show that you are actually a mad person or there are signs of madness in you, because Al- The Qur'an does not have the slightest meaning and meaning, is contrary to our opinion, and violates the beliefs that have been passed down from our ancestors. Is it possible for us to accept something that is not in accordance with our minds and is also not liked by our scholars and scholars.\" From the words of the disbelievers, it becomes clear their true attitude towards the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad. They refute the Qur'an without thinking about and reflecting on the evidence and arguments mentioned in it which explain the signs of Allah's power and greatness that are in themselves, in the livestock they raise, in the plants they grow. plant to meet their needs, on the earth where they live, on the universe, and so on. They deny and deny all of this without pondering and thinking about it first. Their attitude arises because of misguidance, stubbornness, and fanaticism towards their ancestors who have been stuck in them, as Allah says: Every time new verses are sent down to them from God, they listen to them while playing. Their hearts are in a state of heedlessness. And those who were unjust kept their conversation secret, \"(Man) this (Muhammad) is nothing but a human being (too) like you. Did you accept it (the magic) even though you witnessed it?\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 2-3) Due to their inattentiveness and deep fanaticism, they deny the verses of the Qur'an, as Allah says: And every verse of the verses of God that reaches they (unbelievers), everything is always denied. (al-An'am\/6: 4) Their attitude thus creates arrogance and arrogance in themselves, as Allah says: And those who do not expect to meet Us (in the hereafter) say, \"Why don't the angels sent down to us or (why) do we (not) see our Lord?\" Indeed, they have been proud of themselves and have really transgressed (in committing injustice).

According to them, if a prophet or apostle is sent, there must be an angel accompanying him, so that the angel can strengthen his prophethood and apostleship, making it easier for humans to accept his message, or it is sufficient for the prophet to be just an angel. According to their way of thinking, those who carry God's verses are only spiritual beings, while humans are physical beings (can be seen). Humans, even though they have high power, still cannot become prophets and apostles, because they still associate with humans, are in their midst, and still have physical needs, such as eating, drinking, dressing, wanting power, wanting to collect wealth, interested in worldly life, and so on. Therefore it is impossible for a human being to become a prophet and apostle, unless the appointment of prophethood and apostolate is strengthened or confirmed by the presence of angels as companions. The beliefs of the polytheists of Mecca are like the beliefs of Pharaoh and his followers about the apostles and prophets. According to them, all the apostles sent by God should be appointed with a ceremony full of majesty and grandeur, such as the appointment of their kings, wearing bracelets and necklaces made of gold and royal clothing, or the apostle came accompanied by angels, as explained in the word of Allah SWT: \"Then why was he (Moses) not put on a bracelet of gold or an angel came with him to escort him?\" So (Pharaoh) with those words influenced his people, so they obeyed him. Indeed, they are a wicked people. (az-Zukhruf\/43: 53-54)"

			"tafsir": "Allah replied to the ridicule and ridicule of the polytheists of Mecca with this verse, that He will not send down angels because there is no wisdom and benefit. This means that even if Allah swt sent down angels from the sky and appointed them as messengers who conveyed His religion, it would be of no use and would not be able to convince and straighten the beliefs of the polytheists. As it is known that angels are supernatural and subtle creatures so that the human eye will not be able to see them. If Allah swt willed and made the angel in human form, so that human eyes could see it, then Allah sent him as a prophet and messenger to them, the angel ate and drank like them, walked and socialized with them, then it would also appear in their minds that angels those who are given the task of being an apostle are humans too like them, not angels. That is, doubts in themselves will continue to exist. This is explained in the word of Allah SWT: And if We had made the messenger (from) an angel, We would have made him (in the form of) a male, and (thus) We would have made them remain in doubt as they are now in doubt. (al-An'am\/6: 9) From their attitudes and ways as stated in the word of God above, it is evident that their hearts have actually been closed to accept the truth. Whatever evidence is put forward to them, they still will not believe, Allah SWT said: And even though We really sent down angels to them, and people who had died spoke to them and We collected (also) before them everything (that they want), they will not also believe, unless Allah wills. But most of them do not know (the meaning of truth). (al-An'am\/6: 111) Because of their attitude like that, Allah gave them a stern warning that if an angel was sent down, it was a sign that they would be overtaken by a great calamity, and destroyed so that their history would be destroyed. end. This stipulation is in accordance with the sunatullah that has been applied to the previous ummah who have made fun of the messengers of Allah who have been sent to them. Before the punishment was meted out, an angel was sent to them, as had happened to the people of Lut, as the word of Allah swt: They (the angels) said, \"O Lut! Indeed we are the messengers of your Lord, they will not be able to disturb you, so go and your family at the end of the night and do not let anyone of you look back, except your wife. In fact, she (also) will be overwritten (torment) that befell them. In fact, when the punishment for them will be at dawn. Isn't it already dawn? near?\" (Hud\/11: 81) Mujahid in his tafsir of this verse says that Allah sent down angels only as Allah's apostles, signs of the coming of punishment, or carriers of Allah's punishment."

			"tafsir": "This verse is a strong warning to those who ignore the Qur'an and do not believe that it was sent down by Allah to His prophet Muhammad. It's as if Allah said to them, \"You, O disbelievers, are actually misguided people who make fun of the prophets and apostles that We have sent to convey the religion of Islam to you. In fact, your attitude like that will not affect one bit even against the purity and sanctity of the Qur'an because it was We who sent it down. You accuse Muhammad of being mad but We affirm that it is We ourselves who have preserved the Qur'an from all kinds of attempts to pollute it and attempts to add, subtract and change verses -the verses. We will protect it from all kinds of human interference with it. There will come a time when people will memorize, read, study, and explore its contents, so that they obtain from the Al-Qur'an guidance and wisdom, guidance on morals and manners the good, knowledge and thinking guidelines for experts and clever people, as well as instructions for the way of life in the world and in the afterlife later.\" Allah's guarantee regarding the maintenance of the Qur'an is reaffirmed in His words: They want to extinguish Allah's light (religion) with their mouths (sayings), but Allah continues to perfect His light even though the disbelievers hate it. (as-shaff\/61: 8) Regarding Allah's guarantee of the sanctity and purity of the Qur'an and the affirmation that it is Allah who maintains it, it is evident by paying attention to and studying the history of the revelation of the Al-Qur'an, the methods used by the Prophet when broadcasting , maintaining and correcting the readings of the companions, prohibiting writing other than verses from the Qur'an, and so on. Then the maintenance of the Qur'an was continued by the companions, tabiin, and by every generation of Muslims who came after, until now. In order to find out and prove that the purity of the Qur'an that has come down to us today is explained in the history of the Qur'an, both at the time of the Prophet and at the time of the Companions, and the efforts of Muslims to preserve it today. On the other hand, the authenticity of the Qur'an can be traced from the history of its writing and reading. First: Al-Qur'an was revealed gradually to the Prophet Muhammad saw in approximately 23 years. Every verse down, the Prophet told his companions to memorize and write it on stones, animal skins, and palm fronds. The Prophet had several companions who were in charge of writing revelations and accompanying him when verses were revealed. Among the authors of the revelation were Zaid bin Sickle, Ali bin Abi Talib, Uthman bin 'Affan, Ubay bin Ka'ab, and others. Each verse was revealed, the Prophet explained to the authors of the revelation in which part of the verses came down first or in what surah the verse was placed and written. He forbade the Companions to write anything other than the Qur'an, whether the explanations were the tafsirs of the verses or the statements written by the Companions themselves. The hadith of the Prophet as narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: Do not write anything from me other than the Qur'an. Whoever writes anything other than the Qur'an, let him erase it. (Muslim History) The general prohibition is to maintain the purity of the writings of the Al-Qur'an so that they do not get mixed up with other writings besides the Al-Qur'an, both originating from the Prophet and companions. However, there were some friends who were good at reading and writing, writing down the Prophet's sayings as an tafsir of the Qur'an and their notes, such as 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Ali bin Abi Talib, Ibn Abbas, and others. Apart from being written by the revelation writers and some of the friends, the Qur'an was also memorized by the friends and they were required to recite it in prayer. Given the important role of literacy in maintaining the authenticity or purity of the Qur'an, the Prophet greatly appreciated those who could read and write, and encouraged his friends to study it. After the Battle of Badr, the Prophet used the illiterate prisoners of war at Badr to redeem himself by teaching 10 Muslim children to read and write. With this Apostle's decision, the more people who can read and write, the more people who can record and memorize the Qur'an. Thus, there are three factors that help preserve the writings and readings of the Qur'an: 1. Writings or manuscripts written by the authors of revelation. 2. Memorizing from friends who are very enthusiastic about memorizing it. 3. Personal writing or manuscripts written by friends who were already good at reading and writing such as 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Ali bin Abi Talib, and others. In addition to the three factors above, the Archangel Gabriel always checks the readings of the Holy Quran every year. When checking, the Prophet was told to repeat the recitation of the Qur'an that had been revealed. Even before he died, the Archangel Gabriel checked twice. The Prophet himself often checked the readings of his companions. They were told to read the Koran in front of him, and he corrected their readings. The Prophet died after the Qur'an had been revealed and had been memorized by many people according to the orderly arrangement of the Qur'an that we read today, in accordance with the instructions he gave when reading the Qur'an, both inside and outside of prayer . By means of practical practice above, the purity of the Qur'an can be maintained and spread easily in society. After Rasulullah saw died, the friends agreed to choose Abu Bakr as caliph. At the beginning of his reign, many Muslims who were not yet strong in their faith became apostates and some of them claimed to be prophets. Therefore, Abu Bakr fought them. In this battle, 70 people who memorized the Qur'an had died and several people had died before that. At the suggestion of Umar bin Khaththab and accepted by Abu Bakr, Zaid bin Sickle was assigned to rewrite the Qur'an, the manuscript of which had been written at the time of the Prophet and was supported by the memorization of the companions who were still alive. After finishing writing it in sheets, tied with thread, arranged according to the order set by the Prophet, the Mushaf was then handed over to Abu Bakr. After Abu Bakr died, this manuscript was handed over to his successor Umar bin al-Khaththab. After Umar died, this mushaf was kept in the house of Hafsah, Umar's daughter and wife of the Prophet Muhammad, until the time when the Al-Qur'an was recorded during the time of the caliph Uthman bin 'Affan. At the time of the caliph Uthman bin 'Affan, Islamic government areas had reached Armenia and Azerbaijan in the east and Tripoli in the west. Thus, the companions at that time were scattered in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Persia, and Africa. Wherever they go and where they live, Al-Qur'an Al-Karim remains their imam, many of them memorize the Al-Qur'an. They have manuscripts of the Qur'an, but the texts they have are not the same in the arrangement of the surahhs because they are recorded according to their understanding or they are still mixed with the Prophet's explanations as their tafsirs. This led to disputes about the recitation of the Qur'an among them. The origin of this difference in reading is because the Prophet himself gave leeway to the Arab tribes who were in his time, to recite and recite the Al-Qur'an according to their respective dialects. This leeway was given by the Prophet so that they could easily pronounce and memorize the Qur'an. But then there was concern that this dispute over the recitation of the Qur'an, if left unchecked, would lead to unwanted discord and division among the Muslims. The person who first showed concern about this was a friend named Huzaifah bin Yaman. He participated in the wars of conquering Armenia and Azerbaijan. During his journey, he once heard Muslims arguing over the recitation of several verses of the Qur'an and once heard a Muslim say to his friend, \"My recitation is better than yours.\" When this was conveyed to Caliph Uthman bin 'Affan, he immediately agreed to do the writing of the Qur'an, so a team was immediately formed consisting of revelation writers, such as Zaid bin Sickle who became the team leader, 'Abdullah bin Zubair, Sa'id bin 'As and' Abdurrahman bin Haris bin Hisham, and others. The manuscript containing sheets with the inscriptions of the Qur'an, which had been compiled by Caliph Abu Bakr, and kept at Hafsah's house, was requested by Uthman. Because this team was tasked with re-copying the Qur'anic writings in the mushaf and uniforming the readings and writings. The results of this team's work will become a reference and reference for the recitation of the Qur'an by Muslims around the world. In carrying out their duties, this team applies the following conditions: 1. Not to write down unless what is truly believed is the Qur'an, with reference to the writings and memorization of friends. 2. Not written except for verses that are believed to have never been written down. 3. If there is a word that has several different readings, then it is written in the Quraish dialect because the majority of the Qur'an is written in that dialect. 4. If there are two different readings but can be accommodated in one writing, write it in one writing like malik and malik. Mushafs whose readings have been uniformed are known as al-Mushaf al-Imam or al-Mushaf al-'Othmani. This manuscript was multiplied into five manuscripts, each of which was sent to Mecca, Syria, Basrah, Kufa, and one was left in Medina. Thus the Qur'an was recorded at the time of the Companions. All manuscripts published later must be adapted to al-Mushaf al-Imam. Then efforts to maintain the purity of the Qur'an are still being carried out by Muslims around the world, down to the present generation. In order to maintain the purity of the Al-Qur'an in Indonesia, various efforts have been carried out, including: 1. Forming a \"Lajnah Pentashihan Mushaf Al-Qur'an\" which has the task of, among other things, examining all mushafs that will be printed before being distributed to the public. The team is under the supervision of the Minister of Religion. 2. The government already has the Al-Qur'an manuscript which is the standard in the publication of the Al-Qur'an in Indonesia, which has been adapted to the Mushaf al-Imam. 3. Holding annual Musabaqah Tilawatil Qur'an which is handled and managed by the state. 4. Other efforts carried out by the Muslim community, such as establishing educational institutions, studies, and tahfiz of the Qur'an. Muslims in reading the Koran. However, there are also some differences in the readings. The reasons for these differences can be summed up in two ways: First: The writing of the Qur'an itself was not perfect. Second: The differences in the dialects of the Arabs. The writing of the Al-Quran can make a difference because al-Mushaf al-Imam was written by friends whose writings cannot be said to be perfect writing because they have not received punctuation and periods. As explained by Ibn Khaldun in his book \"Muqaddimah Ibn Khaldun\", he said, \"Pay attention to the consequences that occur because the mushaf writings were written by the friends themselves with their hands. The writing was not perfect, so sometimes there were some mistakes in understanding the reading of the text because it is without dots and lines.\" As for the different dialects of the Arabs, which had been tolerated by the Prophet, this gave rise to various qira'at (recitations), so that in the year 200 Hijriah, countless qira'at experts appeared. Among the well-known Arabic dialects are lahjah Quraysh, Hudzail, Tamim, Asad, Rabiah, Hawazin, and Sa'ad. At that time famous qiraat experts appeared, and there were seven famous people, namely: 'Abdullah bin Amir, Abu Ma'bad 'Abdullah bin Katsir, Abu Bakar Asim bin Abi an-Najud, Abu Amr bin A'la, Nafi ' bin Abi Nu'aim, Abul Hasan 'Ali bin Hamzah al-Kisa'i, Abu Jarah bin Habib Ibn Zayyat\/Hamza. Qiraat-qiraat people popularized by the name \"Qiraat Sab'ah\" (seventh reading). As explained above, the Al-Qur'an was originally written without dots and lines, but this did not affect the reading of the Al-Qur'an because the companions and tabiin besides memorizing the Al-Qur'an were also people who were fluent in Arabic. Therefore, they can read it properly and correctly. But after the spread of Islam and many non-Arab nations embraced Islam, it was difficult for them to read the Koran without dots and lines. It is feared that this will lead to errors in the recitation of the Qur'an. So Abul Aswad Ad-Duali took the initiative to provide punctuation marks in the Qur'an with different colored ink. The dot is the dot above for fathah, the dot below for kasrah, the dot on the upper left for dhamah, and the two dots for tanwin. This happened during the time of Ali bin Abi Talib. Then during the time of the caliphs Abdul Malik bin Marwan, Nasr bin Asim, and Yahya bin Ya'mar added signs for letters dotted with the same ink as the writings of the Qur'an to distinguish between the meaning of the dots Abul Aswad Ad- Duali with this new point. Abul Aswad point is for punctuation and Nasr bin Asim point is for letter point. This way of writing remained in effect during the Umayyad period, and at the beginning of the Abbasid empire, and was even used in Spain until the middle of the fourth century Hijra. Later it turned out that this method of marking still creates difficulties for readers of the Qur'an because there are too many dots, while the dots gradually become similar in color. So al-Khalil took the initiative to make new signs, namely the small wau above for dhammah, the lowercase alif for fathah, the lowercase yes for kasrah, the head of the letters sin for syiddah, the head ha for breadfruit and the head ' ain for hamzah. Then these signs were simplified by cutting and adding them so that they became the current form. Thus the efforts of the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims to preserve and safeguard the Qur'an from all kinds of human interference, so that the Al-Qur'an that is in the hands of the Muslims today, is exactly the same as the Al-Qur'an which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad SAW. This is proof of Allah's guarantee that he will preserve the Qur'an forever."

Almost all the apostles were sent to their people alone, without friends and helpers who helped him except for helpers and helpers from followers who were obtained after a lot of preaching. In general, the apostles were poor, with no superiors or authorities to support them, and without sufficient wealth to finance their preaching, but all the apostles were trustworthy, steadfast, and patient in carrying out the tasks assigned to them. With this verse, it is as if Allah swt emphasized to the Prophet Muhammad not to despair because of the attitudes and actions of the disbelievers, because all the apostles experienced trials and challenges like that. Such an attitude of disbelievers is because their morals have been corrupted, and their passions have defeated all truth that might enter their hearts.

Allah swt explained that what the Prophet Muhammad was experiencing had also been experienced by the previous apostles who were sent to the ancient peoples. Almost all of the people made fun of the apostles and some even made evil plans to kill him. They deny the apostle's call and continue to carry out the customs and beliefs inherited from their ancestors. Almost all the apostles were sent to their people alone, without friends and helpers who helped him except for helpers and helpers from followers who were obtained after a lot of preaching. In general, the apostles were poor, with no superiors or authorities to support them, and without sufficient wealth to finance their preaching, but all the apostles were trustworthy, steadfast, and patient in carrying out the tasks assigned to them. With this verse, it is as if Allah swt emphasized to the Prophet Muhammad not to despair because of the attitudes and actions of the disbelievers, because all the apostles experienced trials and challenges like that. Such an attitude of disbelievers is because their morals have been corrupted, and their passions have defeated all truth that might enter their hearts. Therefore, they cannot accept the truth of the verses of the Qur'an that are conveyed to them."

			"tafsir": "After Allah SWT explains His signs of greatness and power in the sky, in this verse Allah explains the signs of His power that humans can see, know, feel and think about. Among other things, Allah created the earth as if it were spread out, making it easy for humans to live in, allowing them to grow crops on it, and making it easier for them to travel to all corners of the world seeking lawful sustenance and having fun. Allah created deep ravines on earth and flowed by small rivers which then united to become large rivers that led to the vast ocean. He also created mountains that soared into the sky, adorned with various kinds of green plants and vegetation, pleasing to the hearts of those who looked at them, as Allah says: And He who spread out the earth and made mountains and rivers river above it. And in him He made all the fruits in pairs; He closes the night to the day. Indeed, in that there are signs (of Allah's greatness) for people who think. (ar-Ra'd\/13: 3) Verse 19 of surahh al-Hijr implies how geological processes run for tens, hundreds and even millions of years. Based on scientific studies, basically the geological process is in the form of a cycle that does not stop. At the bottom of the ocean, such as in the Pacific Ocean for example, there is a process of continuous expansion of magmatic materials that come out of the mid-ocean ridge and form oceanic plates [see description an-Naml\/27: 88 and at-thur\/52: 6 ]. This plate continues to move and crash into other plates. Meanwhile, the process of erosion starts from high places and then the material resulting from this erosion is spread and deposited in lower places. These deposits then experience pressure due to the movement of the plates and bring the eroded rock layers to bend and lift, forming mountains. See also an-Nahl\/16: 15 related to this verse. How great is Allah who created all that can be benefited and enjoyed by humans, but most of them deny their Creator. Allah has created various plants and herbs, each of which has a certain size and degree. The durian tree, with its sturdy trunk, is in harmony with its large, thorny fruit. The stalks of rice match well with the fruit that is stalked and the soil where it grows. Likewise, other plants created by Allah are balanced, harmonious, and in accordance with the climate, regional conditions, and the needs of the humans or animals where they grow. Meanwhile, differences in area and soil where a tree grows will cause differences in the taste and size of the fruit. The element of sugar in sugar cane is different from the element of sugar in coconut water, different in sweetness from mangoes and oranges. Salak fruit when it is still a pistil is surrounded by sharp thorns, but after it is ripe, it is as if the thorns reveal themselves, making it easy for humans to take the fruit which tastes sweet. Papaya pistils taste bitter when they are small, so humans don't want to take and eat them. The bigger the pistil, the less bitter it is, and the closer humans are to it. After cooking, the fruit is picked and becomes a preferred food. Thus Allah creates something with a certain size and level, so that seeing the perfection of His creation will also increase faith in the hearts of people who want to think and also increase the belief that Allah is Most Perfect. Allah swt says: And it is He who makes the plants that have vines and those that do not have vines, date palms, plants of various tastes, olives and pomegranates that are similar (shape and color) and dissimilar (taste). Eat its fruit when it bears fruit and give its due (zakat) when it reaps the fruit, but don't overdo it. Verily, Allah does not like those who are excessive. (al-An'am\/6: 14)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the source of everything in nature is God's creation. All come from the treasury or savings of God's treasury, both in the form of natural resources (SDA) and human resources (HR). Everything that is on the earth or in its stomach was created by Allah for humans. Humans are given the task by Allah to manage, benefit from, and maintain it. This is confirmed by Allah in surahh Hud\/11 verse 61: ¦He has created you from the earth (soil) and made you prosperous, therefore ask forgiveness from Him, then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is very near (His mercy) and allows (the prayers of His servants). (Hud\/11: 61) To be able to take great advantage of the available natural resources (SDA), humans need to develop their human resource (HR) capabilities and skills by mastering various sciences and technologies. Then to really be able to explore natural resources need capital. With a combination or combination of natural resources, namely natural resources, human skills or skills, and sufficient capital, humans can obtain sustenance from Allah for the prosperity and welfare of their lives. This is in accordance with the sunatullah, that is, people who are given sustenance are only those who try and work hard to find it. Trying and working hard to earn sustenance from the treasures of God's treasury must also be accompanied by the responsibility to maintain (conserve) wealth and natural resources, and not damage and destroy them. Therefore, at the end of verse 61 of surahh Hud, Allah reminds people to always ask forgiveness and repent to Allah, and stop acts that damage the natural order that has been determined in sunatullah. This can be known from the understanding of science and technology. A good human according to the guidance of the Islamic religion is one who can carry out his duties well in worship and khilafah (carrying out leadership and good management of nature). He earns his sustenance by working and trying well and earnestly, not destroying and being a burden to others. The hadith of the Prophet narrated by al-hakim has provided guidance, including: From Rifaah bin Rafi that the Prophet was asked, \"Which business is the best?\" Rasulullah said, \"A person's business is done with his hands and all transactions are mabrur (clean trading does not contain elements of deception, coercion, and so on).\" (History of al-hakim) According to this hadith, good sustenance is the result of good work or effort from the person himself (not a gift from someone else), and the result of a mabrur sale and purchase. What is meant by a mabrur sale and purchase is a sale and purchase that is carried out fairly, mutually willingly between the seller and the buyer, without coercion and no lies. Allah's Word: O you who believe! Do not eat each other's wealth in a vanity (unrighteous) way, except in trading that applies on the basis of mutual consent between you. And don't kill yourself. Truly, Allah is Most Merciful to you. (an-Nisa'\/4: 29) Enjoying sustenance from one's own efforts and sweat or the result of buying and selling is an honorable way as a Muslim human being, not because of gifts and compassion from others and not because of businesses that are prohibited by religion, such as taking rights, or buying and selling by force or trickery. Allah is Most Just and Most Wise in giving sustenance to His servants. The point is to give a certain size, according to the needs, circumstances, abilities and efforts of the person. Thus, in the provision of sustenance, God's love for His servants is illustrated. Allah swt said: Say (Muhammad), \"To whom belongs what is in the heavens and on earth?\" Say, \"Belongs to Allah.\" He has fixed (the nature of) compassion on Himself. (al-An'am\/6: 12) The bestowal of Allah's gifts and favors on His servants is mentioned in the Qur'an with the words anzala (sent down), as stated in another of His words: ¦And He sent down eight raise livestock for you (az-Zumar\/39: 6) And the word of Allah swt: .... And We created iron which has great strength and many benefits for humans.... (al-hadid\/57: 25) Something was said descends when he moves from a high place to a low place, both literally and figuratively. Therefore, from this verse it can be understood that the favors and gifts come from Allah, the Most High, the Most Rich, bestowed upon creatures lower than Him. All creatures depend for their entire life and continuation of life on the favors and gifts of Allah. Thus, it is an obligation for every creature to be grateful for the favors and gifts of Allah by serving Him."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains some of the blessings that are in His treasury, that is, He has sent winds to fertilize, develop, and reproduce plants. The meaning of the growth, development, and marriage of plants by means of the wind is: 1. Allah blows a wind that carries clouds containing rain. The longer the exhaled cloud became heavier and blacker, until it turned into a thick black cloud. Regarding the process of rain formation, the following is an explanation based on scientific studies. To explain the occurrence of rain, it must be seen in a full water cycle. All water that evaporates, whether it comes from streams, rivers or the sea, forms water vapor in the atmosphere. This vapor rises and cools as it reaches the higher atmosphere. If there is a lot of gas in the atmosphere, it will condense into gas groups called clouds. If the clouds are blown by the wind so that they gather together, and rise upwards so that they reach a higher part of the atmosphere, the water vapor will turn into ice drops. Dust, or anything that evaporates with it, will likely be trapped by moisture or ice droplets. Thus, the volume and weight of the ice formed will increase. As the clouds get colder due to the lower atmospheric temperature, the water solidifies (ice) and falls, initially as tiny ice drops, which usually melt before reaching the ground. Thus, water drops will fall to earth as rain. In some high mountains or in cold parts of the world, this ice does not melt before it reaches the ground, so it falls as snow or ice. Then from the dark clouds it rained down which wet the surface of the earth, so that the land which was previously dry became fertile. Plants and plants grow and develop and then flower, pistil, and bear fruit. Some of the fruit can only be used by humans and animals, while some others grow and develop again to continue their descent and protect their species from extinction. Some plants grow by planting their stems. With a shower of rain water, the planted stems will grow and develop. Scientifically it can be explained that raindrops contain these revitalizing ingredients commonly known as \"surface tension droplets\". These elements are obtained from the surface layer of the ocean, which is commonly called the \"micro layer\" evaporates. In the outer layer of raindrops, there is a lot of organic litter that comes from the decomposition process of micro algae and zooplankton. Some of this litter collects and absorbs elements, such as phosphorus, magnesium and potassium, which are rare in seawater. This litter also contains heavy metals such as copper, zinc, cobalt and iron. Plants on land, as well as life in the sea itself, will receive most of the mineral salts and other elements they need for life along with the arrival of rainwater. The salts that fall with rainwater are a miniature of fertilizers commonly used in agriculture (NPK elements and so on). Heavy metals in the air that are carried down by rain water will form elements that increase productivity during plant growth and fruiting. Thus, rain is a very important source of fertilizer. Experts estimate that with the fertilizer contained in raindrops alone, within 100 years, nutrient-poor soil can collect all the elements needed for the growth of trees. Forests also grow and obtain their necessities of life from all the chemicals that come from the sea. In this way, it is estimated that every year, about 150 million tons of fertilizer fall to the earth. The process of the wind blowing the clouds, so that they become rain that wets the surface of the earth, revives the dead land, is explained by the word of Allah swt: And it is He who blows the wind (as) the bearer of good news before the arrival of His mercy (rain); and We send down from the sky very clean water. (al-Furqan\/25: 48) 2. Allah swt blows a wind that blows pollen from various flowers. Then the male pollen alights on the flower pistil, so that marriage takes place which gives rise to the ovary, and the ripe fruit tastes delicious and enjoyable for humans and the seeds can grow and bear fruit also in other places. According to scientific studies, the verse above seems to give a hint about the process of the botanical phenomenon known as pollination or persarian. In open-seeded plants (gymnosperms), pollination or persarian is the event of the fall of pollen (pollen) into the ovary (microphyll) which is directly related to the ovule. Whereas in closed seed plants (Angiosperms), pollination or persarian is the event of the fall of pollen from the stamens to the stigma. Pollination is then followed by fertilization or fertilization. This is the process of marriage in the world of botany (plants). Pollination requires an intermediary or vector. Based on the intermediary or vector, the pollination process is grouped into pollination by wind, water, or animals\/insects. The sentence in the verse above which reads 'We have blown the wind to marry implies the event of pollination by means of the wind, which in scientific language is known as anemophily or anemogamy. 3. The wind blows away the dirt and dust that settles on the stems and leaves of plants, so that the plants breathe easily and grow big, and the leaves easily absorb sunlight which increases their sturdiness and fertility. This provides a lesson on how humans make artificial marriages (al-talqih al-sina'i) on various kinds of flower and fruit trees. In this way flowers can be produced with lots of fruit. Even by crossing several types of fruit, more beautiful and more colorful flowers can be produced, as well as more delicious or larger fruit. From artificial mating with plants, humans can then develop artificial mating with several livestock such as cows, goats, horses, and others. These artificial matings produce larger, more meaty animals and are more resistant to disease. This is the case if humans want to learn from Allah's instructions in the verses of the Qur'an. Another favor of Allah swt related to the water that He sends down from the sky as mentioned in this verse is: Allah sends down rain from the sky, then the water is made for humans as a drink that can quench thirst, as the word of Allah swt: Have you ever noticed water what do you drink? Did you send it down from the clouds or did We send it down? If We had willed, We would have made it salty, why are you not grateful? (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 68-70) And the word of Allah swt: And it is He who blows the wind (as) the bearer of good news before the arrival of His mercy (rain); and We send down from the sky very clean water, so that (with that water) We revive a dead (barren) land, and We give drink to some of what We have created, (in the form of) many cattle and humans. (al-Furqan\/25: 48-49) In this verse it is emphasized that Allah is the one who regulates when rain water is sent down and in which area according to His will. However, humans are tasked with regulating the use and storage of water on earth so that the rain which is a blessing does not turn into a disaster. By His will, Allah bestowed water on humans, so that they could drink, wash, irrigate rice fields and fields, and give water to livestock. This water irrigates rivers, lakes and oceans navigable by humans and is an inexhaustible source of sustenance and life. If Allah swt wills, He stores the water in the ground or in the bowels of the earth that can be dug up and pumped by humans who need it, especially during the dry season. This is explained by Allah SWT in His other words. And We sent down water from the sky with a measure; then We caused the water to settle on the earth, and surely We have power to make it disappear. (al-Mu'minun\/23: 18) And His words: Do you not see, that Allah sends down water from the sky, then arranges it into sources of water on earth, then with that water He grows various plants -various colors, then it dries up, then you see it is yellowish, then He makes it crumble. Indeed, in that there is a lesson for people who have common sense. (az-Zumar\/39: 21)"

			"tafsir": "In a history conveyed by at-Tirmizi and al-hakim from Ibn Abbas it is explained that this verse was revealed in connection with a beautiful woman who prayed following the Prophet. Therefore, some of the companions who wanted to pray following the Prophet advanced to the first row so they could not see the woman. They were worried that by seeing the woman's face, the prayer would become invalid. While some of the other friends retreated to the back in the hope of seeing the woman's face when bowing through their armpits. So this verse came down to denounce the friend's actions. Allah swt knows the intentions of the friends who advance to the first row and the intentions of the friends who retreat to the back row. This shows that some of the Prophet's companions as human beings were very kind, very careful about their prayers so they would not see beautiful women for fear that they would cancel the prayer. However, there are those who actually want to see the beautiful woman. This is reasonable and humane in nature, and has not yet reached the sinful act that violates religion. Even though this verse was revealed with the events above, it also includes Allah's knowledge of everything that is implied and etched in one's heart. Based on this sabab nuzul, Ibn 'Abbas interprets al-mustaqdimin wal-musta'khirin as the virtue of praying in the front row compared to praying in the back row. Some scholars interpret it as knowledge of humans who were created first, humans now, and humans who were created later. Another meaning of al-mustaqdimin wal-musta'khirin is that Allah knows the past and the future of mankind. There are also scholars who interpret al-mustaqdimin as people who hasten to do good, and al-musta'kirin with the opposite meaning. In this verse, Allah swt confirms that He is the Almighty who knows everything that preceded it and the events that have occurred from the biggest to the smallest. He knows what is in the present, and knows what will happen in the future, nothing that He does not know."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that after perfecting the form of His creation, Allah then breathed a spirit upon him. According to scientists, the word pest' (black mud) in this verse indicates the involvement of water molecules (H2O) in the process of forming molecules that support life processes. As is well known, 'water is a medium for the occurrence of a chemical\/biochemical reaction process to form a new molecule. The word \"formed\", implies that the biochemical reactions taking place in the aqueous medium have transformed the elements, which were originally 'only atoms' into an organic molecule, having a certain structure and shape, such as amino acids or nucleotides. In another verse, Allah swt explains the human incident: He created humans from dry earth like pottery, and He created the jinn from smokeless flames. (ar-Rahman\/55: 14-15) Scientifically, pottery is a kind of porcelain, which in a chemical reaction process can be used as a catalyst for the polymerization process to occur. The word \"dry earth like pottery\" may indicate the occurrence of a polymerization process or a chain extension reaction of molecules from amino acids to proteins or from nucleotides to polynucleotides, including Desoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules, a building block for the genetic structure of living things. And the word of Allah swt: (Remember) when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed I will create man from dust. Then when I have perfected the incident and I blow My spirit (creation) on him; then submit yourself by prostrating to him.\" (shad\/38: 71-72) What is meant by insan (human) in this verse, is Adam as who is the father of all mankind. Some commentators are of the opinion that the Adam referred to in this verse is not the first human being, because before that Allah SWT had created thousands of Adams. But the Prophet Adam was the first prophet who was given the task of preaching to humans to follow the right path. In the hadith of the Prophet, the process of Adam's creation is explained. The Prophet Muhammad saw said: Indeed, Allah 'Azza wa Jalla has created Adam from a fist of earth taken from all kinds of soil, then the child of Adam was born according to the level of the soil. Some of them are red, some are black, and some are in between the two colors. Some are easy, some are difficult, some are good, and some are bad. (History of Ahmad and Muslim from 'Aisyah)"

In accordance with the hadith above that human nature varies according to the condition of the land that forms it, then this can be used as an argument that the character of the jinn is in accordance with the nature of the origin of the incident. As fire is hot, so is the character of the genie. The fire can suddenly become big, then suddenly become smaller and smaller. Likewise the jinn, like to be in a hurry, get angry quickly, like to play games and hurt humans, sometimes submit and obey Allah, but immediately disobey and disobey Allah. Humans are in accordance with the nature of the origin of events, such as being patient, likes to grow, develop, maintain and look for something good, likes to heed orders, has the nature of being submissive and obedient, although sometimes he is disobedient to Allah because he is submissive and follows his desires. In the hadith qudsi it is mentioned the origin of the occurrence of angels, jinns and humans based on the history of 'Aisyah: Allah swt said, \"I have created angels from light, and I have created jinn from flames of fire and Adam has been created as explained to you.\" (History of Ahmad and Muslim from 'Aisyah) Jin including God's creatures. As with other creatures of Allah, there are jinn who obey Allah and there are also those who are disobedient, as Allah says: And indeed among us (jinn) there are those who are pious and there are (also) the opposite. We took different paths. (al-Jinn\/72: 11) Jinn was given a burden and responsibility by Allah, as humans are given a burden and responsibility, it develops and reproduces. It's just that humans can't see it, while he can see humans. Therefore, there are jinns who are submissive to Allah, and there are also rebellious ones like the Devil. Allah swt said: And among us there are those who are Muslims and there are those who deviate from the truth. Who are Muslims, then they have chosen the straight path. (al-Jinn\/72: 14) According to Ibn 'Abbas, what is meant by jan (jinn) in this verse is the father of all jinns, just as Adam is the father of all humans. Satan is the father of all demons. Jinn also eat, drink, live and die like humans. Allah swt said: O children of Adam! Don't be deceived by Satan, just as he (Satan) brought your parents out of heaven, by undressing both of them to show their nakedness. Verily he and his followers can see you from a place where you cannot see them. Verily, We have made the devils a leader for those who do not believe. (al-A'raf\/7: 27)"

He will create man from dry soil that comes from black mud, and when He has perfected his form to the best of his ability, will breathe into it the spirit of His creation and will command angels and demons to bow down to him in homage to him. This command of Allah is carried out by the angels obediently and solemnly, except for the Devil. He was reluctant to prostrate to Adam, because he felt he was higher in rank than Adam. He was created from fire, while Adam was created from dust. Most commentators are of the opinion that the events of Adam's creation and the events of Satan's denial of God's commands as well as the obedience and sincerity of angels in carrying out those orders illustrate the character of the three types of God's creatures. Angels were created as creatures who are always submissive and obedient to God's commands, never denying them in the slightest. Therefore, angels were made by Allah as bodyguards and rulers of the earth with His permission, and were ordered to submit to Adam and his descendants. Humans are God's creatures which consist of two elements, namely physical elements and spiritual elements. The combination of these two kinds of elements causes humans to have the potential to benefit from the whole earth with the knowledge that God has bestowed upon them. There are various possibilities for him to act and work in order to meet and complete the needs he needs by exploring and taking them from the treasury of Allah swt. With self-potential and knowledge, humans can utilize water, air, minerals, plants, livestock, orbits of the planets, electricity, atomic force, and so on. Thus, the superiority of humans from angels and demons can be seen, as can be understood from God's answer to the angels when Adam was about to be created by God. Allah swt said: And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels, \"I want to make a caliph on earth.\" They said, \"Are you going to make someone who destroys and sheds blood there, while we glorify your praise and sanctify your name?\" He said, \"Surely I know what you do not know.\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 30) Above has been explained the denial of Satan who does not want to follow God's command to prostrate to Adam. Also explained are the various reasons put forward by Satan in connection with his denial. Such an attitude of Satan shows his stupidity and wickedness, because: 1. He goes against the commands of his Lord, as understood from his answer. 2. He presented very weak reasons. Those excuses showed his own stupidity. 3. He did not want to follow God's commands by saying that he was better than Adam. 4.

Don't be deceived by Satan, just as he (Satan) brought your parents out of heaven, by undressing both of them to show their nakedness. Verily he and his followers can see you from a place where you cannot see them. Verily, We have made the devils a leader for those who do not believe. (al-A'raf\/7: 27)"

According to Ibn Juraij, hell is seven levels, the first is Jahannam; the two Ladhas; third Huthamah; fourth: Sair; the fifth Saqar; the six Jahims; and the seventh Hawiyah. Each level is occupied according to the degree of their sins. From these verses it can be understood that humans have two kinds of prominent characteristics, namely first, having a nature that likes to follow lust and is influenced by worldly life with all kinds of life's pleasures that fascinate him. They are polytheists who are easily influenced by Satan. Second, humans who have the nature of believing in Allah and the Messenger, have a clean and noble soul, have a very close relationship with Allah, and like goodness.

God has borne on them. Their sudden arrival at his house was unexpected by Lut a.s. and he did not know at all who the guests who had come were. This is illustrated in Lut's words when welcoming his guest, \"Indeed you are strangers.\" In another word of Allah, Lut's anxiety and ignorance of his people are also described. Allah said: And when Our messengers (angels) came to Lut, he felt sad because of their (arrival), and (felt) had no power to protect them. (al-'Ankabut\/29: 33) From the verse it is understood that the reason for the worry and anxiety of the Prophet Lut was the arrival of the guests to his house suddenly and unexpectedly. The angels disguised themselves as beautiful men who were very liked by Lut's people who liked to do homosexual acts. Usually when a man like that came, Lut's people would flock to his house and force Lut to hand over his guests to them. If Lut as knew for certain that the angels were coming, he would not have worried because he believed that the angels could defend and defend themselves from their actions."

In this verse, the answers of the angels are mentioned, \"Indeed, we have come to you with the doom that they always deny.\" Even with the words, \"We have come to punish them.\" The purpose of the angels' answers with such words was to state the truth of the threats that Lut used to convey to his people so far. Prophet Lut as always warned his people to follow and embrace the religion he had conveyed and acknowledge his apostleship. If they persist in denying, they will be overwritten by Allah's punishment. They greeted Lut's exclamation and statement with ridicule. They do not believe in the oneness and power of Allah who can punish those who deny. They even challenged Lut to immediately bring down the promised doom. Then the angels confirmed to Lut that the purpose of their arrival was to carry out the task that Allah swt had assigned them to deliver doom to his people. This task must be carried out and everything they say is true, because they themselves are angels who have never violated God's commands. After that, the angels gave orders to Lut as regarding ways that he and his followers should carry out to avoid Allah's punishment that would come. Lut and his family and people who had believed were ordered to immediately leave the country at the end of the night. Lut as was asked to walk behind his followers, so he could manage and defend himself from attacks from his people who were chasing from behind. This was also intended so that Lut as could encourage his followers to walk as fast as possible, because the doom that was about to be inflicted was near, and he could pay attention to his people who did not want to continue their journey. Furthermore, the angels ordered that none of Lut's followers looked back when they heard the devastating thunder. Thus, they cannot see the terrible events that can damage and shake their souls, so they are safe and their faith grows stronger to the safe place they are going to. In this verse, it is stated that Lut departed with his family and loyal people. Then the angels strengthened his commands and prohibitions by saying, \"Continue your journey to the place that you have been commanded to do.\" According to a history, the place referred to in this verse is the land of Sham (Syria). In surahh Hud, the story of Lut is told in the order of events that once happened, while in this surah it is told in skips, not according to the actual sequence of events. The difference in the way of telling this story is because God's purpose in telling this story in the two surahhs is also different. If connected with the previous verses, the purpose of telling the story of Lut in surahh Hud is to strengthen the hearts of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, in conveying Allah's religion and declaring the oneness and power of Allah who must be worshiped. The apostles sent by God have always faced challenges and threats from their people, but they remained steadfast and patient in carrying out the tasks assigned by God to them. While the purpose of Lut's story with his people in surahh Al-Hijr is to explain to those who believe in the mercy and favors of Allah that they have received. Also the blessings that have been received by those who believed long ago in the messengers that Allah sent to them. Among them are the favors bestowed upon the Prophet Ibrahim as in the form of the sons he has always yearned for, and the favors bestowed upon the Prophet Lut and his followers.

The country is located in the Madyan region. The people of Aikah adhere to polytheistic beliefs, like to rob and rob people who pass through their country, and cheat when weighing and measuring. Prophet Shuaib as was sent to them, but they denied it."

Allah then sent a cloud, then they took shelter under it. Suddenly from within the cloud emanated a flame that scorched them. In surahh al-A'raf\/7: 91, it is explained that they were also hit by a terrible earthquake. Then an earthquake came upon them, and they died lying in the ruins of their homes. (al-A'raf\/7: 91) Then Allah SWT explained that the city of Sodom and the city of Aikah are two cities that are close together, both are located on roads that are usually passed by humans. In fact, their former remains can still be seen and studied, so that they can be used as a lesson by those who are willing to use their minds."

This verse mentions the apostles even though they only belied one apostle, namely Prophet Saleh, because to deny one apostle is the same as denying all of Allah's apostles. All the apostles sent by Allah carried the monotheistic religion and the same religious principles. Even though they have denied an apostle, they have denied monotheism and religious principles that the apostle brought, which means they have belied all the apostles. The city of al-Hijr is the home of the Samud located between Mecca and Sham, near Wadil-Qura. Prophet Saleh was sent to them, who was given a miracle as proof of his apostleship. Saleh stated his miracle in the form of a she-camel that they knew as proof of his apostleship. The camel should not be disturbed or hurt. The amount of drinking water was determined alternately, that is, one day for the camels to drink and one day for all of them. But they did not want to follow Saleh's provisions, they even slaughtered the camel."

They carved rock mountains to make their houses, so their city was named \"city of al-hijr\" which means city of rock mountains. Because of their disobedience, Allah inflicted punishment on them in the form of a loud sound that thundered and destroyed them all. The harsh doom came in the morning of the fourth day of the day that Saleh had set for them to think. But they paid no heed to it, so they were buried in their houses which were caves hewn into the rocks. Their condition is explained by Allah in another of His words: Then a thunderous voice fell on the unjust people, so that they died in their homes. It was as if they had never lived in that place. Remember, the Samud people denied their God. Remember, the Samud people perished. (Hud\/11: 67-68) The Samud cannot escape Allah's punishment in the slightest. There is no use for the might of their bodies, their ability to carve mountains to make a house as if it were a solid fortress, as well as their many treasures and numbers. Everything was destroyed with them, as if the land had never been inhabited by humans.

Likewise, the stories of the people that used to be told to be used as references, parables, and parables for people who want to believe in the power and greatness of Allah. Then Allah swt emphasized that the Day of Judgment will definitely come, there is not the slightest doubt, because at that time Allah will perfect his reward for humans according to the deeds they have done. Good deeds are rewarded with heaven, while bad deeds are rewarded with the punishment of hell. Allah warns that if people do not want to believe in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad, and do not want to take the lessons and experiences that have been experienced by the past peoples, then the Prophet was ordered to turn away from them, and show a good attitude, high manners, and forgive their unnatural behavior towards him. This verse explains the attitudes that must be possessed by a preacher in particular and all Muslims in general in conveying the religion of Allah and dealing with disobedient people. The Muslims are only obliged to convey the religion of Allah, and are not required to force and make them (disobedient people) believe, which makes a person's faith and disbelief only Allah."

It is not explained in this verse what is meant by \"as-sab'ul matsani\" and \"the great Qur'an\". However, there is a hadith explaining that what is meant by as-sab'ul matsani and the great Qur'an is surahh al-Fatihah. The hadith is: From Abi Said Al-Mu'alla he said, \"The Prophet passed before me while I was praying, so he called me and I did not go to him until I finished praying. Then I came to him, then the Prophet said, \"Why you do not come to me.\" I replied, \"I am praying.\" He said, \"Not that Allah has said, \"O you who believe, accept the call of Allah and the Messenger,\" then he said, Know! I will teach you the most glorious surahh in the Qur'an, before I leave this mosque.\" So the Prophet went out and I reminded him, then he said, \"Al-hamdu lillahi rabbil-'alamin is \"as- sab'ul-matsani\" and \"the great Qur'an\" which he gave me.\" (Al-Bukhari) In another hadith, Rasulullah saw said: Ummul-Qur'an is as-sab'ul- matsani and the Great Qur'an (History of al-Bukhari) Many other authentic hadiths explain that as-sab'ul-matsani and the Great Qur'an are other names for surahh al-Fatihah. commentators are of the opinion that what is meant by as-sab'ul matsani in the verse above is as-sab'uth-thiwal (the seven surahhs of the Qur'an which have the longest verses), namely surahh al-Baqarah, Ali 'Imran, al-Ma'idah, an-Nisa, al-A'raf, al-An'am, and at-Taubah or al-Anfal.The seven surahhs are called as-sab'ul-matsani, because in the surahhs the seven repeated mentions of tales, laws, monotheism, and others. However, this opinion contradicts the above authentic hadiths. Meanwhile, part of the surahh as-sab'uth-thiwal was revealed in Medina, while the verse that explains this as-sab'ul-matsani is Makkiyah. It is called as-sab'ul-matsani (seven repetitions) because surahh al-Fatihah consists of seven verses which are repeated in every cycle of prayer. A Muslim prays at least seventeen cycles a day and a night. Therefore, they read al-Fatihah at least seventeen times a day and a night. It is called the great Al-Qur'an because the contents of surahh al-Fatihah are the main points of the entire Al-Qur'an, and are also in accordance with the meaning of the hadith above."

The gift is in the form of instructions to the right path and cannot be valued by any amount of wealth. Therefore, Allah swt warns believers not to feel disheartened and grieve over the worldly pleasures that Allah has bestowed on disbelievers. It is inappropriate for someone to turn his attention from something that is noble and of high value to something that is of less value, especially if the pleasures of this world are obtained in a way that is not justified by God. All that is temporary pleasure, then they will be put into the burning hell fire. This verse is in line with the word of Allah SWT which forbade the Messenger to see the pleasures given to the disbelievers: And do not fix your eyes on the pleasures that We have given to some groups of them, (as) the flowers of the life of the world so that We may test them with ( pleasure) it. Your Lord's gift is better and more lasting. (thaha\/20: 131) Allah swt forbade the Prophet Muhammad saw to grieve against unbelievers who did not heed his call. Allah's prohibition is because the Prophet saw really hoped that all people would believe and hoped that disbelievers would not be overwritten by Allah's punishment in the afterlife because of the vastness of His mercy. Allah's prohibition also reminded the Prophet that his duty was only to convey Allah's religion, not to force people to believe. Then Allah decided that the Prophet was gentle and told the disbelievers that Allah's punishment would befall them if they continued in disbelief and misguidance, as had been inflicted on people before them."
