			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah praises Himself by sending down the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad, whom he calls \"His servant\" to serve as a warning to the universe (humans and jinns). With praise for Himself because He sent down the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad, it can be understood that the Qur'an is a book that is very important and has a very high value in the sight of Allah, because the Al-Qur'an is a guide and life guidelines for His creatures that He glorifies, namely humans, while other creations both in the heavens and on earth are for the benefit of humans themselves. In this verse Allah does not mention the Al-Qur'an but al-Furqan because the Qur'an is the difference between right and wrong between guidance and misguidance. The Qur'an was revealed to all mankind during the time of the Prophet Muhammad and afterward until the Day of Judgment, because the prophets before Muhammad saw were only sent to his people while the Prophet Muhammad was sent to humans at all times and in all places. Likewise, Allah does not mention the name of Muhammad or His Messenger but calls \"His servant\" because he wants to glorify Him with that title. A human being who truly enslaves himself to Allah confesses His oneness and power, obeys and obediently carries out His commands always makes His guidance the guideline of his life, loves Allah essentially more than anything in this world, that is the true servant of Allah, servant of Allah contained in this surahh al-Furqan. In other verses Allah mentions the Prophet Muhammad with the title \"His servant\" as His words: Glory be to (Allah), who has traveled His servant (Muhammad) at night from the Grand Mosque to the Aqsa Mosque which We have blessed around him . (al-Isra'\/17: 1) And His word: And verily when the servant of Allah (Muhammad) stood worshiping Him (carrying out prayers), they (jins) were crowding around him. (al-Jin\/72: 19) And His words: Praise be to Allah who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to His servants and He has not made it crooked. (al-Kahf\/18: 1) After Allah mentions Himself Who sent down al-Furqan to His servants, then He characterizes Himself that He is the owner of the heavens and the earth and has power over both, sends and manages it according to the wisdom of wisdom- It is in accordance with the interests and benefits of each of His creations. Allah also stated that He had no children as alleged by the Christians, the Jews and the polytheists, as stated in His word: And the Jews said, \"Uzair son of Allah,\" and the Christians said, \" Christ the son of God.\" Those were the words that came out of their mouths. They imitated the words of the former disbelievers. Allah cursed them; how did they turn around? (at-Taubah\/9: 30) And His words: So ask (Muhammad) to them (the Meccans), \"Are the daughters for your Lord while they are the sons?\" or did We create angels in the form of women while they witnessed (it)? Remember, among their lies they actually said, \"God had a son.\" And really, they are total liars. Did He (Allah) choose daughters over sons? (as-shaffat\/37: 149-153) Furthermore, Allah stated again that He is not partnered with others in His power, only He is worthy of worship and it is Him alone that humans must ask for something, not as done by humans who have gone astray who worship His creatures like worshiping humans, idols and other objects. Then Allah also stated that He is the Creator of everything according to His wisdom and arranges it according to His will and Knowledge. In short, everything in nature, both in the heavens and on earth, is His creation. He is the Creator, there is no Creator besides Him, there is no partner for Him who is worthy of worship, all are under His rule and subject to the sunnah and regulations that He has established. Never imagine or cross the minds of humans that He has children or has allies."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains in this verse that the idols worshiped by disbelievers do not have the slightest meaning, and do not have the slightest attribute of perfection, and even the characteristics possessed by idols are merely the characteristics of sheer deficiencies. It is very strange the way of thinking of people who make idols as gods, worship them and ask for help from them. Among the disgraceful characteristics of idols are: a. These idols cannot create anything, while the one who deserves to be worshiped is Allah, the Creator. b. The idols themselves were made by the worshippers. How stupid are humans who worship their own creations that are lower in degree than themselves. c. The idols are powerless and do not have the energy to carry out an action, cannot bring any benefit to themselves, let alone to their worshipers, cannot defend themselves, let alone to defend and help others. Of course, there is no point in worshiping images of such a nature. d. These idols cannot turn on or off or gather people to account for their deeds. As for himself, the idol cannot give life because it turns out that he is still an inanimate object, let alone giving life to other people. These are the characteristics of the idols worshiped by the polytheists of Mecca. Why don't they worship Allah who has the perfect nature of the One and Only God, Almighty over all things."

			"tafsir": "The disbelievers say that the Qur'an is not a book sent down by Allah. The Al-Qur'an is just a lie concocted by Muhammad and in making the Qur'an he was assisted by a group of people of the book who have believed. According to them, Muhammad always met with the group of people of the book and they taught him the stories about the previous peoples, then Muhammad compiled the stories in Arabic with good editorial composition. It was narrated that these verses were revealed about Nadr bin al-Haris and the people who helped Muhammad were Addas the slave Khuwatih bin Abdul Uzza, Yasar slave al-A'la bin al-Khadrami and Abu Fukaihah ar-Rumi. Originally they were adherents of the Jewish religion who were good at reading the Torah and told many stories about the history of the ancient people. Then they converted to Islam and had a lot of contact with the Prophet Muhammad. That is why Nadr bin Haris dared to make these false accusations. So Allah rejected the accusation and said that those who made the false accusations were unjust and lied. It is clear that the accusation is fabricated because the Qur'an itself with its verses has challenged the Arabs to make a surahh that is as fasahah and balagah as a surah from the Qur'an. If they don't succeed, surely the Qur'an was not made by Muhammad but was really a revelation from Allah. It is mentioned in His word: And if you doubt (the Qur'an) that We sent down to Our servant (Muhammad), then make a surah like it and invite your helpers besides Allah, if you are people of truth . (al-Baqarah\/2: 23) Since none of them can answer the challenge even though they have tried their best, it is true that the Qur'an is not man-made but a revelation from Allah. But since there is no way for them to go against the Qur'an, they look for various excuses to belie it and they make reports like the one mentioned above."

			"tafsir": "The disbelievers said that the Qur'an was just the tales of the ancients which they wrote down in books, and the Prophet Muhammad asked the Jews to copy and read to him so that he could memorize them morning and evening. After memorizing it, he read it to his friends and followers as the Qur'an that descended from the sky. How dare they invent something that never happened to the Prophet Muhammad. If so, surely his friends would know about it and surely they would no longer believe in him. Even though the Prophet Muhammad was known to them since his childhood as the most trusted, honest and never lying. Is it possible that someone who has been like this since childhood will deceive those who are loyal to him and preach nonsense. (6) Because the disbelievers made unreasonable accusations too far, while they had been challenged in such a way and could not answer the challenge, Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to declare to them emphatically that the Qur'an and it is not what they accuse. The Qur'an was truly sent down by Allah who knows all the secrets hidden in the heavens and the earth. Therefore, there are in it Shari'a laws and regulations that are very good and in a language that has a very high literary value so that none of them can imitate it. The Qur'an contains many things that cannot be known except by Allah, the Most Knowledgeable. Indeed, Allah, who sent down the Qur'an, is Most Forgiving and Merciful to His servants. Actually they should be grateful and grateful for His mercy and compassion for them by sending down the Qur'an as a guide and guide them to the right path. But they remained disobedient and disobedient and opposed His teachings. Had it not been for His mercy and compassion, a painful punishment would have been inflicted upon them."

He is just an ordinary person like them, even if you look at how his life has increased, it is clear that he lied, preaching himself as an Apostle because he is the same as them, even as a human, he is lower in position and poorer than them. These criticisms can be summed up as follows: 1. They said, \"Why did Muhammad eat and drink like an ordinary human and there is not the slightest advantage over us, it would be impossible for him to have a relationship with God. People who can relate to God are only people -people whose souls are pure and high so they don't care about eating and drinking anymore.\" 2. Why wasn't an angel sent down with him who could prove his apostleship and help him in giving warnings and instructions to people. 3. Why did Muhammad go to the market to make a living like ordinary people? Where lies the advantage that he was appointed by Allah as an Apostle. 4. Why doesn't Allah just send down treasures from the sky to him so that he can devote all his attention to preaching to spread his religion, so that he no longer has to go to the market to buy and sell to make a living. 5. Or why not give him a large garden whose produce can cover his needs. After they gave up because all their offers were rejected by Muhammad, there was no other way for them except to accuse him of being a person who was enchanted so that he could no longer distinguish between good and bad. According to them people like that do not deserve to be trusted let alone to be appointed by Allah as a Prophet."

By paying attention to these criticisms it is clear that they have run out of reasons and explanations to reject the Prophet Muhammad's call to monotheism and abandon their misleading worships. They were unable to reject the reasons and evidence put forward by the Prophet Muhammad in the form of verses from the Qur'an and others. They are unable to answer the challenge of making one surah that has the same value as one surah in the Qur'an, both in terms of content, meaning and literature. Therefore they shifted their criticism to the Prophet Muhammad himself. This happens a lot to people whose hujjah has been defeated. For this reason, Allah did not immediately answer these criticisms and ordered to show them so that it would be clear to everyone that they had been thrown into a corner because they had indeed strayed from the right path."

That is very easy for Allah but that is not what He wants. Allah wants the Messenger to carry His message as an ordinary human being who becomes a follow-up and role model for his people in fighting for an ideal, fighting for truth and exalting God's sentence. Apart from this very hard struggle, the Prophet had to think about his personal needs and wishes. That's how an Apostle should be an example and role model. If the Prophet Muhammad was a rich man who had gardens and palaces and abundant treasuries, surely the value of his struggle would not be that great and certainly would not be emulated by his followers in the future. What is the meaning of a palace, what is the meaning of gardens and what is the meaning of an abundant treasury when one is dealing with His Creator, the Almighty, the Most Rich and the Most Mighty? Thus the Prophet Muhammad was pleased with his situation. even though he is poor, weak and receives various insults and ridicule from his people, he is happy and happy because he is carrying out a holy task from his Lord. Once he said, \"O my Lord, whatever happens to me and no matter how hard my suffering is, I will still be happy as long as You are pleased with me.\""

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains to the Prophet Muhammad that the previous messengers also ate and drank like him. The criticisms of the disbelievers against him really hurt Muhammad's heart, these criticisms were not merely criticisms, they even contained insults that greatly demeaned him even though he was a Messenger who was glorified by Allah. So to console and relieve the inner pressure that the Prophet Muhammad was suffering from because of the criticism and humiliation, Allah revealed to him that He had never sent a messenger before as desired by the Meccan infidels. All the Apostles he sent were human beings who were not free from their human nature, but needed food and drink, still trying to make ends meet in accordance with His words in other verses. And We did not send (messengers) before you (Muhammad), but men whom We gave revelations to them, so ask those who are knowledgeable, if you do not know. And We did not make them (the apostles) a body that does not eat food and they do not (also) live eternally. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 7-8) So the difference between humans as messengers and humans in general lies in personal excellence, high morals, purity of heart and sincerity in carrying out their duties, because of that Allah's revelation was sent down to him and strengthened by miracles which no human can match it let alone defeat it. So the ridicule and criticism of the disbelievers was very far from its target, it was not natural for the Prophet Muhammad to be hurled at him. If they really want to overturn the truth they bring, then they shouldn't come up with such criticisms. They have been challenged to match the miracle given to them by Allah which is to make just one short surahh that is equal in value to the short surah of the Qur'an. But they are powerless and unable to make it even though they are already included in the class of people who are smart and have high literature. Only hatred and envy had darkened their consciences and the fear of losing influence and position had filled them with anger. Because of that they are still challenging even though in their hearts they have realized their mistake. Then Allah also explained that humans are tested with various tests. Each human being is given the freedom to decide whether he will be steadfast and patient in facing the test or will he turn away from the truth because he cannot bear the anger and envy in his heart. Allah made some people as Prophets and Messengers, bearers of His Lord's message, some others He made kings and rulers who ruled over other humans, some others He made rich and strong, poor and weak and so on. People who use their minds and minds, especially those who believe will not be affected by differences in levels, degrees, wealth and position, but they will still accept the right and reject the wrong regardless of where the truth comes from, whether the truth comes from a head of state or a minister or from a lowly person has no influence whatsoever. Ali bin Abi Talib once said, \"Pay attention to what is said and do not pay attention to who is saying it.\" The poor are tested for their fortitude in the face of their deprivation, unlike the rich who can enjoy various kinds of physical pleasures with their wealth. The Meccan infidels were tested for the purity of their hearts by giving the gift of the apostleship to the Prophet Muhammad, while he was an ordinary person among them, not from rich people or from a clan leader who had great influence. All humans are tested for their mental strength in the face of differences and gaps between various groups in society. Whoever wins in the face of the test is the one who will get the happiness of life both in this world and in the hereafter. In a hadith narrated by Imam Muslim, Rasulullah SAW said: \"Look at people who are lower in rank than you, and don't look at people who are higher than you, because looking at people who are higher will lead you to lower the value of the favors that Allah has bestowed. to you.\" (Muslim history) Such is the test that Allah gives to His servants, and He knows best which of His servants is steadfast and patient in facing the test so that he is among those who pass and win. He will give the best possible reward to the winners and will inflict torment on the losers who because of their impatience and because of their arrogance have disobeyed the favors He has given them."

If it is difficult to implement, why don't they just see God who will explain to them that Muhammad was really sent by Him to deliver good news and give a warning. If that happened, they said they would believe in Muhammad. Such words are nothing but because of their own arrogance, and because of their tyranny by denying a messenger of God. They completely ignored the real miracles that the Prophet had shown them. Any reasonable person would be astonished to hear their words and regard them as the words of an unreasonable person. If Allah grants that wish, they still will not believe in Allah and His Messenger, as stated in the word of Allah: And even though We really send down angels to them, and people who have died speak to them and We collect them (also) in before them everything (that they desire), they will not also believe, unless Allah wills. But most of them do not know (the meaning of truth). (al-An'am\/6: 111) 21. This verse explains another reason made up by the polytheists of Mecca because of their reluctance to believe in the Prophet Muhammad. And those who do not expect to meet Us in the Hereafter because of their denial of the existence of the Last Day, or because of their fear of it, they say, \"Why are not the angels sent down to us in a manifest form, who inform us about the truth of the Prophet Muhammad, or why do we not see our Lord? with our eyes which also tell us about the truth of the Prophet Muhammad.\" These requests are clearly far-fetched, the same as what the Children of Israel did before. This clearly comes from their hearts full of envy. Indeed, they have been arrogant because they are seduced by their desires. They think that they are more noble, either because of their wealth or their position in society. And they really have exceeded the limit in committing tyranny. Thus if the heart has been covered by disbelief, all the truth that exists in front, even though it was already brightly lit, they were not ignored at all."

The angels they want as messengers in this world, or as witnesses of the truth of Muhammad's prophethood, they will meet in the afterlife. However, the meeting was not as they expected because they would not hear any good news from the angels, either forgiveness from their sins, or orders to enter heaven. They only hear words that are very hurtful, namely hijran mahjuran, which means \"(heaven) is unlawful and unlawful for them\". The angel's speech was considered very painful, because Arabs usually say it when they get into trouble. As for the believers, they are welcomed by the angels who come to meet them and give them the good news of entering heaven. This is described in the word of God: Indeed, those who say, \"Our Lord is Allah,\" then they strengthen their stand, then the angels will come down to them (saying), \"Do not be afraid and do not grieve ; and be happy with (acquiring) the paradise that has been promised to you.\" (Fussilat\/41: 30)"

(an-Naba'\/78: 19-20) When the heavens split open; and when the stars fall scattered; and when the seas are made overflowing; and when the graves are dismantled; (then) every soul will know what has been done and what (it) neglected. (al-Infithar\/82: 1-5) On that terrible day, angels descended in waves carrying books containing records of all the deeds of Allah's servants that they witnessed and recorded while in the world. These books became evidence when they were judged by Allah in Padang Mahsyar. According to scientists, this verse, like many other verses in the Qur'an, confirms the existence of astronomical events of extraordinary awesomeness that will occur on the Day of Judgment. Everything points to the overall breakdown and destruction of the system that connects the parts of the universe. Including the total change in position, form, and connections between elements in this universe. A final picture and a total change that does not only occur on earth, but also includes all the heavenly bodies in this universe. The stars 'fall down, collide with each other, because of the destruction (loss of) gravity, the sky is split and the planets clash and scatter. The white mist depicts all the trillions of celestial bodies, as if they look like fog. At that time these celestial objects \"jumped\" out of the sky as if pushed from within by a huge pressure that forced them out of the sky \"balloon\". Stars, planets and other celestial bodies are like small and light dust which has no power whatsoever. The balance and order between the components of the system in the universe at that time no longer existed. The heavenly bodies collided with each other and exploded. It could be that even the white mist is the clouds that have accumulated from the vapors produced from the explosions."

Allah says: And the Qur'an (We sent it down) gradually so that you (Muhammad) read it to people slowly and We sent it down gradually. (al-Isra'\/17: 106) The gradual revelation of the Qur'an does contain many lessons, including: 1. The Prophet Muhammad often met the angel Gabriel so he received lots of advice to increase enthusiasm, patience, and fortitude in fulfill his message. 2. Because the Prophet Muhammad could not read and write (ummi), if the Al-Qur'an were sent down all at once, it would be difficult for him to memorize it. 3. So that the memorization is more stable, perfect, and avoids all mistakes. 4. If the Al-Qur'an were sent down all at once, the Shari'a would have been sent down all at once. This is sure to cause a lot of trouble. However, because of its gradual decline, the Shari'a was implemented gradually so that it was easy to implement, both for the Prophet and his followers. 5. Because the revelation of the Qur'an has a lot to do with the reasons for its revelation, such as various questions, events or incidents, its gradual revelation made a more lasting impression on the hearts of friends because they could live it event by event. 6. If the Al-Qur'an was revealed gradually, they were not able to imitate the Al-Qur'an even in one verse, especially if it was revealed all at once. 7. Some of the Islamic sharia law came down according to the development of the Muslims at that time.

Allah makes the shadows lengthen or shorten to be used by humans as a measure of time, such as in Egypt using a tool called al-Misallat to measure the time during the day and determine the seasons throughout the year. Since time immemorial, the Arabs have also used a tool called al-Mazawil to determine prayer times with shadows.

			"tafsir": "Then Allah removes the shadows slowly as the sun sets little by little. According to scientists, this verse speaks of the precise order of the universe. This verse describes the function of movement and the \"length\" of the shadows that move from morning, noon, and evening. Lengthening the shadow of an object in physics is the event of decreasing the angle of incidence of light and shortening the length of the shadow due to the greater angle of incidence of light. We often encounter these events in our daily lives. In the morning, the shadows of objects exposed to sunlight falling on the earth will appear long. The later in the day and until the position of the sun is at the culmination point, the shadow will appear to be getting shorter. On the other hand, when the sun begins to shift westward until late afternoon, you will see that the shadows are getting longer again. This happens because the angle of incidence of sunlight becomes smaller again. What happens when the long shadows stay the same or don't change? This is an extraordinary event. In simple terms, it can be interpreted that the position of the sun and the earth remains unchanged, so the sun will shine on the earth continuously. This means that the earth's surface (which is bright) will experience a heating process. The surface temperature will continue to increase as long as the irradiation lasts. Seawater will bubble and boil. If this continues for a long time, the earth will burn and be destroyed due to increased temperatures. While the surface of the earth that is not facing the sun, will experience the opposite process, which is experiencing extraordinary cooling. Perhaps the sea surface would freeze, and life would die. Temperature extremes in these two hemispheres may lead to the extinction of life. Doomsday? Wallahu a'lam. Allah is Almighty over all His creation. The long and short events or the west and east directions of the shadows relative to the position of the sun can be a time indication for humans who are on earth. The disappearance of the shadows occurring slowly is as simple a description as the events of a slow setting sun. The second thing that can be obtained is that the verse above has indicated that there will be a rotation of the earth on its axis. The verse below can also be used for such indications. And the sun goes where its circulation. Such is the decree of (Allah) the Almighty, the All-Knowing. And We have determined the place of rotation for the moon, so that (after it reaches the last place of circulation) it returns like the form of old bunches. It is not possible for the sun to overtake the moon and for the night to precede the day. Each circulates in its orbit. (Yasin\/36: 38-40). The verse above can also be used to show the existence of order in the universe. The last sentence of the verse clearly states it. The same thing can also be found in surahh al-Anbiya'\/21: 33, az-Zumar\/39: 5, and ar-Rahman\/55: 1-5. In surahh Yasin\/36: 38-40 above it is stated that the sun revolves around its trajectory. Modern astronomy proves the truth of this statement of the Qur'an. As is known, the sun is located on the outer side of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. This galaxy is disk-shaped, which has a radius of about 10 kiloparsecs. If calculated in the mil dimension, it is equal to 2 with 17 zeros. Astronomical research shows that the Milky Way galaxy makes rotations on its axis (revolution), and one revolution takes 250 million years. Because the sun is in the outer disk of this galaxy, the sun also circulates according to the orbit of the outer side of the disk of the galaxy. The word yasbahun found in surahh Yasin\/36: 40, is more appropriate when translated by swimming, rather than circulating. Because, in modern astronomy, this space is not completely empty, but is filled and filled with sub-atomic particles known as neutrinos. So all celestial bodies in this universe are actually 'swimming on neutrino waves. Regarding the earth's rotation, the data shows that the earth rotates on its axis at a speed of 1,670 km per hour. This speed is close to the speed of bullets released from modern weapons, which is 1,800 km per hour. So you can imagine, how fast the earth's rotation. What makes this fast rotation is not a small and light object like a bullet, but an object with a very large size and mass. The speed of the earth's orbit about the sun is about 60 times the speed of a bullet, which is about 108,000 km per hour. At this speed, an airplane will be able to circle the earth in 22 minutes. The exact rotation that causes day and night to occur on this earth is confirmed by the verse below. It is not possible for the sun to overtake the moon and for the night to precede the day. Each circulates in its orbit. (Yasin\/36: 40)"

Allah also causes deep sleep for humans so that it is as if they are dead, because a person is not conscious at all while sleeping, and his limbs stop working except for the heart and several other organs. Thus, he can rest perfectly as in the word of Allah: And it is He who makes you sleep at night. (al-An'am\/6: 60). Allah holds the life of (a person) at the time of his death and the life of (a person) who has not died when he sleeps. (az-Zumar\/39: 42) Allah made the day for trying and doing activities. Just as sleeping at night is likened to dying, so waking up during the day is likened to waking up again from death. Likewise, humans, after their life span in this world ends and dies, will be resurrected after their death, to be judged by Allah for everything they have done while living in this world."

With rain water too, Allah gives water to most of His creatures, such as livestock and humans. In another verse it is explained: And you see the earth is dry, then when We send down water (rain) on it, the earth will live and become fertile and grow various kinds of beautiful pairs (plants). (al-hajj\/22: 5) And His words: So pay attention to the traces of Allah's mercy, how Allah revives the earth after death (dry). Indeed, it means that He will definitely (power) bring the dead back to life. (ar-Rum\/30: 50) According to scientists, from the verse above two things can be discussed, namely: 1.Regarding the occurrence of rain 2.Regarding the indication that rainwater brings life, so that it can \"...bring life with it a land that die...\" Regarding the occurrence of rain, the story begins with water flowing along a creek that will join with other tributaries to form a much larger river, which eventually flows into the sea. While water flows through streams and rivers, some of it evaporates in the heat of the sun (turns into gas) but most of it continues to flow down to the sea. It is in this sea that the next process of evaporation or evaporation takes place. All water that evaporates, whether it comes from streams, rivers or the sea, forms water vapor in the atmosphere. This vapor rises and cools as it reaches the higher atmosphere. If there is a lot of gas in the atmosphere, this water vapor will condense into a group of gases called clouds. If the clouds are blown by the wind so that they gather together, and rise upwards so that they reach a higher part of the atmosphere, the water vapor will turn into ice drops. As the clouds get colder due to the lower atmospheric temperature, the water solidifies (ice) and falls, initially as tiny ice drops, which usually melt before reaching the ground. Thus, water drops will fall to earth as rain. (See also ar-Ra'd\/13: 17; an-Naml\/27: 60; al-'Ankabut\/29: 63; Luqman\/31: 34; as-Sajdah\/32: 27; Fathir\/35: 27; az-Zumar\/39: 21; Qaf\/50: 9-11)."

Sometimes it comes down day or night, sometimes it is intended to water the ground of a people who have just performed the Istisqa prayer, sometimes it is turned away from people who have committed a lot of iniquity and disobedience. All of this is for the purpose of humans taking lessons from it, and so that they understand that it is God who regulates the turn of the rain just as he regulates the circulation of the stars and planets in outer space. Rainwater is not only falling which is regulated by turns, but the shape and condition as well. Sometimes that water freezes if the temperature goes below zero and is an ice cube. Then when heated it turns into liquid, and when heated it turns into vapor. Water is an element that is present in all living things, in plants, animals and humans, as in the word of Allah: And We created all living things from water. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 30) All of this should be food for thought for humans in order to be grateful for God's blessings. However, most people are reluctant to even deny these blessings."

In this verse, Allah forbade the Prophet Muhammad to follow the disbelievers who invited him to compromise with them in matters of religion. He must remain firm and consistent in carrying out da'wah and jihad in spreading the Qur'an. In language, jihad is trying really hard, if necessary by sacrificing anything, property or life. Jihad can be carried out in a state of war or peace. In a state of war, jihad is carried out with qital, namely fighting in the way of Allah. While jihad in peace can be carried out in the fields of economy, education, culture, and others. Verse 52 is included in the group of Makkiyyah verses, revealed before the migration in a state of peace. So jihad here is more emphasized on the seriousness of carrying out da'wah, education, and social efforts to improve people's conditions.

However, even though they are close together, the taste of the water does not mix as if there is a wall separating the two, so that one does not spoil the taste of the other. Although according to the eyes of the two seas are mixed, in reality the fresh water is separated from the salty by Allah's power as in His word: He let two seas flow which (later) both met, between the two there is a boundary that is not exceeded by each -respectively. (ar-Rahman\/55: 19-20). According to scientists, Allah has created a separator for sea and river water, even though the river water falls swiftly from a high place. This barzakh (separator) functions to prevent the two waters from erasing each other's characteristics. The salty and fresh seas are as if there is already a dividing wall between the two, so they don't get mixed up. Man can make his choice because both salt and fresh water are useful. In 1873, British oceanographers (with the Challenger ship) discovered differences in the characteristics of the sea in terms of salt content, temperature, types of fish\/animals, and so on. Each type of water groups by itself in a certain way, separate from other types of water however far it flows. The water of the Amazon River, which flows swiftly into the Atlantic for up to 200 miles, is still fresh. The springs in the Persian Gulf have their own unique fish and each does not live except in its location. The two seas referred to are the oceans which fill about ¾ of the earth and the rivers that are accommodated by the land and which emit springs and large rivers which then flow into the oceans. Barzakh (separator) is a water reservoir that is in the earth and the channels in the earth that prevent sea water from mixing with river water so that it does not turn it salty. The state of salt water that penetrates or flows from the ocean to the rocks near the coast, but it does not mix with fresh water that penetrates or flows into the sea from the mainland. The position of the river flow is higher than sea level, allowing relatively little fresh water to penetrate the salty sea water but not to mix completely. Another related verse is: He let two seas flow which (then) both met, between the two of them there is a boundary which neither of them exceeded. (ar-Rahman\/55: 19-20)."

(al-Qiyamah\/75: 37-39) Allah created a very beautiful human being whose body structure is equipped with five senses, perfected with reason and the ability to think. Humans are also given all the facilities so that everything that is on the surface of the earth is reserved for them. Allah's Word: Do you not see that Allah has subjected what is in the heavens and what is in the earth to your (interests) and perfected His favors for you physically and mentally. (Luqman\/31: 20 In terms of science, some of the verses related to the verse above are: And did those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were both one solid, then We separated them. And We made of them from water is everything that lives. So why do they not believe. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 30). And Allah has created all kinds of animals from water, so some of them walk on their bellies and some walk on two legs while some walk on four legs. Allah creates what He wills, verily Allah is Almighty over all things. (an-Nur\/24: 45). The three verses above indicate a close relationship between water and the existence of life. 1. Water is suspected to be very close to living things. Humans and most animals originate from sperm fluid. 2. All life begins from water. Water here is more accurately interpreted as the sea. This chemical chain is believed to start from the depths of the ocean . It is suspected that it was in the sea that life began because the atmospheric conditions at that time had not yet developed into an area habitable for living things. From this description, the role of water for life is very clear, starting from the existence of living things on earth (originating from the depths of the sea), for their survival (water is needed for the formation of organs and carrying out organ functions), and starting life (especially for the group of animals \"water particularly those derived from sperm)."

If the night and day did not alternate, and the sun continued to shine, this would undoubtedly create a feeling of boredom or boredom and tiredness for not being able to rest at night. Likewise, if the night continues without being interspersed with sunlight, it will surely bring damage to the creatures that need it. The alternation of day and night provides an opportunity to make up for deficiencies in sunnah worship, that is, if someone due to busy work during the day does not have time to pray or read the wird, then it can be carried out at night, as stated in an authentic hadith: Verily Allah stretches out his hands Him at night so that those who sin during the day may repent and reach out His hand during the day so that those who sin can repent during the night, until the sun rises from its setting. (Muslim history from Abu Musa). It is narrated that Umar bin Khaththab once prayed Duha for a long time. When he was reprimanded by a friend, he replied that he had left some of the wirid today, due to being busy, so he intended to make up for the lack by praying the Duha prayer, then he read this verse 62. Night, day, sun and moon are the four favors of Allah. God created the night so that humans can rest due to the darkness of the night. Day was created by Allah with the rising of the sun to work. Allah created the sun and the moon, each having its own axis and orbit. Tirelessly, and never still, everything is constantly circulating. Alternation of day with night can only be a change from light to dark. However, psychologically, the change from light to dark has a completely different mood from that during the day. Various experiments have been carried out to observe how the psychological influence on night workers. Psychosomatic symptoms (physical symptoms caused by psychological causes) were observed, ranging from only nausea to rather severe mental depression. This is only a short-term effect on human physical and psychological. Long-term effects can have a more severe effect. Therefore, God outlines the night to rest and the day to work. So working at night which is called overtime is contrary to human nature as outlined by God. This condition is not surprising because during the day the earth gets exposure to visible light, begins to shift to yellow at sunset, shifts to infra-red during Isha prayers, to ultraviolet when the night is late, and approaches dangerous gamma waves closer to dawn. . This exposure causes humans to suffer psychosomatic if they don't rest and are forced to work."

These qualities can all be summed up into 9 characteristics which if a Muslim possesses, he will gain the pleasure of Allah in this world and in the hereafter, and will be placed in a high and noble position, namely in the Na'im heaven. These characteristics are: First: When they walk, their attitude and simplicity are visible, they are far from arrogance, their steps are steady, regular, and not artificial with the intention of attracting people's attention or to show who they are. That is the nature and attitude of a believer when he walks. Allah said: And do not walk this earth arrogantly. (al-Isra'\/17: 37) Second: If someone says something inappropriate or obscene towards them, they don't reply with similar words. However, they answered with good words, and contained advice and hope that they would be guided by Allah, the Most Gracious, Most Compassionate, and Merciful. Likewise with the Prophet's attitude when he was attacked and insulted with harsh words, he remained tolerant and continued to sympathize with these immoral people. Al-Hasan al-Basri explains that the believers are always open-minded, and never say harsh words. If impolite words are spoken to them, they are not emotional and do not reply with impolite words either. Maybe there are people who think that such traits and attitudes show weakness and lack of self-esteem, because it's normal for someone who acts impolite to be reciprocated with impolite behavior. However, if you think deeply about it, it will surely bring prolonged strife and strife. Every believer must prevent protracted disputes and enmity. One of the most appropriate and effective ways to eradicate it is to repay bad actions with good actions so that people who commit bad actions will feel ashamed and realize that they have done something unnatural. This kind of attitude is explained by God in His word: And good is not the same as evil. Reject (the evil) in a better way, so that the person with whom you have enmity will be like a loyal friend. And (these good qualities) will not be awarded except to people who are patient and will not be bestowed except to people who have great luck. (Fussilat\/41: 34-35). Such are the characteristics and attitudes of believers when they are in the daytime where they always remember fellow servants of Allah."

It is this awareness and conviction that is firmly planted in the heart of every Muslim who has earned the nickname \"servant of Allah, the Most Merciful.\" This verse explains how a believer is really afraid of falling into the torments of hell because the torments are very painful and terrible. Hell is the worst place prepared for God's servants who deny and disobey. The disbelievers remained in it forever, suffering various torments. Even though their skins have been scorched by fire and the heat of the fires of hell has penetrated into their flesh and bones, they still live to feel the torment as stated in His words: Verily, those who disbelieve in Our signs, We will one day put it in hell. Whenever their skins are charred, We replace them with other skins, so that they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Mighty, Most Wise. (an-Nisa'\/4: 56)."

Extravagance will inevitably lead to the destruction of property and the destruction of society. Someone who is extravagant even though his personal and family needs have been met by living in luxury, will still squander his wealth on other pleasures, such as gambling, playing women, drinking, and so on. Thus, he destroys himself and the people around him. In fact, the wealth that God has entrusted to him must be properly cared for so that it can be of benefit to himself, his family and society. Miserliness and stinginess will also lead to loss and damage. A miserly person always tries to accumulate wealth even though he himself lives as a poor person and he doesn't want to spend his money for the benefit of society. If it's for the sake of himself and his family, he feels reluctant to spend money, let alone for the benefit of other people. Thus, the wealth will be piled up in one or several humans who are greedy and greedy. People who are like this are threatened by Allah with the fires of hell as mentioned in His word: Woe to every slanderer and detractor, who collects wealth and counts it, he (man) thinks that his wealth can make him eternal. Never! Surely he will be thrown into (hell) Hutamah. (al-Humazah\/104: 1-4). Such is the nature of the believer in spending his wealth. He is not extravagant so that he does not think about tomorrow, nor is he miserly so that he torments himself because he wants to accumulate wealth. It is the balance between the two kinds of despicable nature that is always maintained and maintained. If he is rich, he can help his people according to his wealth, and if he is poor, he can control his desires by living simply. Yazid bin Abi Habib said, \"That is the nature of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad. They did not eat for luxury and enjoy delicious food, they did not dress to boast about beauty. However, they ate just to cover their hunger. and to strengthen the body because they want to worship carrying out God's commands. They dress simply to cover their genitals and protect their bodies from the wind and heat. 'Abdul Malik bin Marwan, when he married Fatima (his daughter) to 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz, asked future son-in-law, \"How do you provide for my child?\" Umar replied, \"I choose the good of the two bad traits\" (meaning the good nature of the two bad traits, namely wasteful and miserly). Then he recited this verse."

He really adheres to pure monotheism. If he worships, then his worship is only for Allah, and if he does good deeds, his actions are for Allah and not because of him or to be praised by others. When he prays, his prayers are really offered directly to God's presence, not through intermediaries. He fully believes that only God can answer his prayers. They do not kill anyone because they realize that a person's soul belongs to him. He may not be killed except with rights that have been determined by Allah, such as apostasy or killing people without rights. They will not commit adultery because they realize that adultery is a grave sin, an act which is highly condemned and displeased by Allah. By maintaining the purity of monotheism which is the basis of aqidah, a person will have a clean soul, clear mind, and cannot be swayed by misleading beliefs. By staying away from killing without rights, he will be cleansed from unjust acts and the community will be cleansed from chaos. The rights of every member of society will be properly maintained so that they can really enjoy security and peace. By protecting oneself from adultery, one will be cleansed from filth and the society will be cleansed from disturbances and lineage disturbances that cause various difficulties and instability. In connection with this, in a hadith the Prophet explained: 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah, 'What is the greatest sin? The Messenger of Allah replied,' You make a match for Allah even though He created you. I asked also, 'What other sin? Rasulullah replied,' The sin of killing your child because he is afraid (poor) because he will eat with you. Then I asked again, 'What other sin? Rasulullah replied,' The sin of adultery with your neighbor's wife. Allah revealed this verse to confirmed the words of the Prophet Muhammad. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Then Allah threatens those who commit these sins with a very harsh threat, namely hell on the Day of Judgment as recompense for all the sins they have committed in the world. In fact, Allah will multiply their punishment for the great sin they have committed. They will be cast into hell and will remain there. Besides suffering physical torment such as very hot drinks that burn their throats and intestines, they also suffer mental or spiritual torment, because they are always humiliated and always regret their mistakes in the past."

According to some commentators, the replacement of evil sins with good rewards is to erase all sins that have been done in the past because of true repentance, then the good deeds done after repenting are multiplied in reward so that they can erase the sins that have been committed before. Other commentators say that Allah gives the repentant person a reward equal to the amount of sin he has committed. Then he repents and does good deeds, then the good deeds will be rewarded double as well. So the person who repents gets two good things, namely his previous sins are erased and then he is also given a reward equal to the number of sins he has committed. In a hadith, it is narrated that: From Abu thawil Syathab al-Mamdud, he faced the Prophet and asked, \"What do you think about a person who commits all sins, there is no sin unless he commits it. Is his repentance accepted? The Prophet replied, \" Have you converted to Islam?” He replied, “I myself testify that there is no god but Allah, the One and only God and He has no partner. And you are the messenger of Allah.\" The Prophet said, \"Yes, that's right. You do good and leave bad. Then Allah will make for you the good of everything.\" He asked again, \"All my mistakes are forgiven?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Prophet. ) Then Allah states that repentance that is accepted must be accompanied by good deeds. Repentance begins with regret for the evil deeds that have been carried out, and stops from doing immorality, accompanied by good deeds to prove that repentance is true repentance and is done sincerely -really (nasuha)."

When passing in front of people who like to say things that are not good and have no benefit at all, he left without joining them. He realized that a believer is not worthy of serving people who waste their precious time on nonsense, especially if that time is used to talk about things that lead to sinful acts such as gossiping about people or accusing innocent people and others and so on. Swearing falsely is strictly prohibited in Islam, because when swearing it, someone has lied and has not stated the truth. There are so many people who commit perjury to defend people who are not right so that people can usurp or have other people's rights and commit injustice. In fact, if he does not participate in the oath, of course those rights will be real and clear, and there will be no injustice or deprivation of rights. As a believer, he must stand on the right side and must feel responsible for upholding justice and eradicating injustice. Umar bin Khaththab was very angry with people who committed perjury and he once whipped a person who perjured 40 times, smeared his face with black, shaved all his head of hair, and then paraded him in the middle of the market. The character and attitude of these praiseworthy servants of Allah are described by Allah in His word: And when they hear bad words, they turn away from them and say, \"To us our deeds and to you our deeds, may you be safe, we don't want to (associate) with stupid people.\" (al-Qasas\/28: 55)."

It is not surprising that they are very fanatical about this teaching, because they really believe in its goodness. There is a very big difference between them and the polytheists who are also fanatical about their worship. Their fanaticism is blind fanaticism because they do not want to accept the truth even though it is clear and obvious that the creed they hold is wrong and contrary to common sense. No matter how strong and clear the reasons put forward to them about the untruths of their understanding they will not want to accept it because their hearts are closed and their eyes are blind to think about what is right and what is wrong."

His wife and children are truly heartwarming and soothing because their family consists of people who are pious and fear God. Thus, there will be more and more servants of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, on this earth. In addition, they pray to Allah so that their descendants become people who are completely pious, become callers for people to be pious, and become leaders for those who are pious. This is the light of faith that has filled their hearts and illuminated them with guidance and guidance so that they are eager for more and more pious people who receive guidance. Their desire for their children and grandchildren to become leaders for pious people is not because they want a high position or absolute power, but solely because of their sincere desire for the world's population to be filled with people who believe and are pious. It is also intended that their children and grandchildren will continue their struggle to uphold justice and truth. Thus, even though they themselves have died, they still receive the reward for the struggle of their children and grandchildren in accordance with the words of the Prophet: \"When a person dies, all his deeds are cut off except from three kinds: alms that can be used by people, knowledge left behind that can be taken benefits by others after his death, a pious child who always prays for him.\" (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah). These are the nine good qualities possessed by the servants of Allah, the Most Merciful. If someone has these characteristics, then they are entitled to get that nickname. People who get nicknames will surely be loved by Allah and in the hereafter will receive gifts and graces that are very noble and great."
