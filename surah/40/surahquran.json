It is the last holy book that justifies the previous holy books, and is truly revealed from Allah, Lord of the Worlds, God Almighty, no creature can beat Him, God knows everything, nothing is hidden. to God however small and subtle. Allah's Word: This book was sent down from Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise. (al-A.hqaf\/46: 2) The Holy Qur'an could not have been made by other than Allah and it could not have been made by Muhammad as alleged by the enemies of Islam. This has been confirmed by Allah in the Qur'an with His words: And it is not possible that this Qur'an was fabricated by other than Allah. (Yunus\/10: 37) And His words: Is it appropriate for them to say he (Muhammad) made it up? (Yunus\/10: 38) In fact, the Holy Qur'an was revealed with various backgrounds, containing instructions for humans to bring humans out of darkness into bright light. Allah's Word: (This is) the Book that We sent down to you (Muhammad) so that you bring people out of darkness into bright light with God's permission, (that is) to the way of God Almighty, Most Praised.

			"tafsir": "In this verse, five kinds of attributes of Allah are explained that sent down the Qur'an: 1. The Forgiving of Sins This attribute of Allah is also emphasized in another verse, as Allah says: Tell My servants that I am the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful . (al-hijr\/15: 49) And His word: Indeed, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. (az-Zumar\/39: 53) No matter how many sins a person has, if he sincerely asks Allah for forgiveness, then Allah will forgive all his sins as explained in the hadith Qudsi as follows: O My servants, indeed you have made a mistake during the day and night, and I forgive them all sins, then ask forgiveness of Me, I will surely forgive them. (Muslim history from Abu dzarr) In another Qudsi hadith, Allah also emphasized: Allah said, \"O son of Adam! As long as you ask and hope in Me, then I will forgive the sins that are in you and I don't care anymore .O son of Adam! If your sins (piled up) and have reached the clouds of the sky, then you ask forgiveness from Me, I will surely forgive them and I do not care anymore.(Narrated at-Tirmidhi from Anas bin Malik) 2. Recipient of Repentance This attribute of Allah also emphasized in another verse in the Qur'an: Do they not know that Allah accepts the repentance of His servants (at-Taubah\/9: 104) Someone who has committed crimes such as persecution and others, then he repents, regrets his actions, strengthens his faith, does good, and remains in the way of Allah, then Allah will accept his repentance, as He says: the rhyme of repentance. (al-Ma'idah.\/5: 39) And His words: And indeed, I am Forgiving to those who repent, believe and do good, then remain in guidance. (thaha\/20: 82) And His word again: Except for those who have repented, made corrections and explained (it), they are the ones whom I accept their repentance and I am the Most Accepting of repentance, the Most Merciful. (al-Baqarah\/2: 160) 3. His Punishment Is Very Severe. Regarding this Allah said: Â¦That all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is very severe in His punishment (they will surely regret it). (al-Baqarah\/2: 165) Those who do evil, wallow in sins such as denying and denying Allah's verses, taking the wrong path, that is, other than the path which He has shown and outlined, they are the ones who receive Allah's severe punishment and hard, as He says: They denied Our verses, so Allah punished them because of their sins. Allah is very severe His punishment. (ali 'Imran\/3: 11) In another verse Allah confirms: Truly, those who deny the verses of Allah will get a severe punishment. Allah Almighty again has a punishment. (ali 'Imran\/3: 4) And His word also: Indeed, those who stray from the path of Allah will receive a severe punishment, because they forget the day of reckoning. (shad\/38: 26) 4. Gift Giver. Every gift and favor we get is from God as His word: As a gift and favor from God. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. (al-hujurat\/49: 8) And His word: And all the favors that are in you (come) from Allah. (an-Nahl\/16: 53) No human being, in any way, can give a definite number of the many gifts and favors that Allah has given him, as His words: And if you count the favors of Allah, surely you can't count it. (an-Nahl\/16: 18) 5. Allah is One One of the characteristics of Allah that must be believed in is that He is One, there is no God but Him, there is no partner for Him, there is nothing similar to Him, as Allah says: There is nothing like Him. And He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. (asy-Shura\/42: 11) If He had partners, there were other gods who had power equal to His power, then this world would be destroyed as Allah says: If in both (in the heavens and on earth) there were gods other than Allah , surely both have perished. Glory be to Allah who has the 'Throne, from what they attribute. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 22) Those who say that Allah is one of the three are among those who deny and disbelieve, because in fact Allah is One, there is no god but Him, Allah says: Indeed, people have disbelieved -people who say that Allah is one of the three, even though there is no god (who has the right to be worshiped) other than the One God. If they do not stop what they are saying, surely those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment. (al-Ma'idah.\/5: 73) This verse ends with an assertion that all creatures will return to Allah and there will be perfected the reward for them according to their respective deeds as the word of Allah: And fear the day (when) you are all returned to Allah. Then everyone is given a perfect reward according to what he has done, and they are not wronged (harmed). (al-Baqarah\/2: 281)"

Among their sayings is that the Koran is just poetry, magic, myths of the ancients, or other belittling accusations. In fact, it is clear and known by the public that everything in the Qur'an is true. A debate that is questioning the contents of the Qur'an is a very disgraceful act and constitutes disbelief, as the words of the Prophet Muhammad: Debating the contents of the Qur'an is disbelief. (Ahmad's history from Abu Hurairah) As for debates that question something with the intention of finding and strengthening something that is right, explaining what is still vague, taking a legal understanding, rejecting ideas and beliefs that are distorted and not in accordance with Islamic teachings , as well as opposing the understanding that belittles the contents of the Qur'an, is a good and commendable deed. In fact, that is the act that is the duty of the prophets. At the end of this verse, Allah warns the Prophet Muhammad not to be deceived by the luxuries that his opponents got, their freedom of movement from one city to another, buying and selling and trading as they pleased so as to obtain wealth piled up. After all, all of that has a limit, and its temporary nature is equal to its lifespan at most. After that they will get a very painful torment in the hereafter. Allah's Word: Never be deceived by the activities of disbelievers (moving) throughout the country. It's just a temporary pleasure, then their place of return is hell.

Noah's people denied the Prophet Noah, as well as other people, have denied the prophets and apostles who were sent to them, such as the 'Ad, Samud, and others. In fact, apart from denying the apostles, they also planned a plot against the apostles. They fought against their apostles and persecuted at will. They never stop opposing, denying, and debating the apostles with false and unfounded reasons. Among their words were that the apostles were ordinary people like them too, with the intention of releasing the truth, obscuring the rights that come from Allah, and always turning off and extinguishing the light (religion) of Allah, as Allah said: They want to extinguish the light Allah's (religion) with their mouths (sayings), but Allah rejects it, instead wants to perfect His light, even though the disbelievers do not like it. (at-Taubah\/9: 32) Allah does not remain silent seeing the evil deeds that show their moral depravity. They were punished with very painful torments and destroyed by Allah, some were even destroyed so that it was as if they had never existed on this earth. The people of Muhammad saw, especially the residents of Mecca, can see the traces of their destruction as narrated in the Qur'an: And indeed you (people of Mecca) will really pass through their (traces) in the morning, and at night .

The angels also ask for forgiveness for those who acknowledge the oneness and holiness of Allah from worship other than Him. Regarding how the angels carried the Throne and how many of them carried it, it is sufficient for us to believe as it is and return it to God's knowledge, because this includes matters for which no details can be found, both in the Al-Qur'an and in the hadiths which mutawatir. Besides purifying and praising Allah, the angels also always pray for the believers. These prayers, among other things, describe the following: First, that God's knowledge encompasses everything. Allah's mercy includes the forgiveness of their sins and mistakes and God's knowledge includes their actions, speech and movements. It is easy for Allah to forgive sins and mistakes because His mercy is wider and greater than sins and mistakes. There is no deed even in a dark place, not a word or utterance, not even the conscience or the whisper of the soul, there is no deed or movement unless it is known by Allah. Second, asking Allah for forgiveness for those who repent, stop the sins that have been committed, follow what they are told to do, practice good deeds, and leave bad things. Third, the angels also begged the believers to be protected from the torments of the Hellfire according to God's promise."

Sa'id bin Jubair explained that when a man enters heaven he says, \"O God! Where are my father, grandmother and mother? Where are my children and grandchildren? Where is my wife?\" The answer was that they did not do good deeds like what they had done. He then said, \"O my God! I do good for myself and for them.\" So they were equalized in heaven and he then read this verse. In line with this verse the word of Allah: And those who believe, along with their children and grandchildren who follow them in faith, We bring them together with their children and grandchildren (in heaven), and We do not reduce the reward of their deeds (virtue) in the least.

His miracles include a stick turning into a snake and his hands glowing. However, they rejected this teaching and disobeyed, even claiming to be God.

			"tafsir": "In these two verses it is emphasized that the Prophet Musa was sent by Allah as His Messenger to Pharaoh, Haman and Karun to call them to faith. Pharaoh was the King of Egypt who saw himself as God. Haman was the prime minister. Meanwhile, Karun was the richest merchant and billionaire at that time. The three of them are specifically mentioned in this verse, because they were personally responsible for the influence they had on the people of Egypt to belie the Prophet Musa and worship Pharaoh. If these three people have faith, then the people of Egypt will soon believe too. Prophet Musa was sent by God to them with the teachings in the Torah holy book and the miracles given to him. The essence of the teachings that the Prophet Musa conveyed to them was to believe in God Almighty, do good, and believe in the afterlife where humans will receive the reward for their deeds. His miracles include a stick turning into a snake and his hands glowing. However, they rejected this teaching and disobeyed, even claiming to be God. The series of events preaching the Prophet Musa to Pharaoh, among others, is expressed in the following verses: Has the story of Musa reached you (Muhammad)? When God called him (Moses) in the holy valley, namely the Tuwa Valley; go to Pharaoh! Verily he has exceeded the limit, then say (to Pharaoh), \"Is there your desire to cleanse yourself (from misguidance), and I will lead you to the way of your Lord so that you fear Him?\" Then (Moses) showed him a great miracle.

			"tafsir": "Prophet Musa explained to Pharaoh, Haman, and Karun about Allah as God Almighty and the obligation of humans to believe and do good, as well as about His apostleship. However, they were furious. They did not want to accept what the Prophet Musa said because it was contrary to the belief that had been instilled in the people of Egypt that God was Pharaoh. Also because the teachings brought by the Prophet Musa could endanger their power and position. Then they ordered that the sons of the Children of Israel be killed and spared their daughters. The order to kill the sons of the Children of Israel is the second commandment. The first order was issued by Pharaoh on the advice of his astrologers who interpreted his dream that from among the Children of Israel a son would be born who would overthrow him and tear down his kingdom. The purpose of the killing was to weaken the Children of Israel, because their men would be finished, while their women would be overpowered. It also aims to exterminate the Bani Israil ethnic from the land of Egypt because they can defeat the native Egyptians themselves. However, God had other plans. With His plan, Allah actually made Musa, who was still a baby, raised and raised in Pharaoh's own palace as his son. As an adult, Moses had to get out of Egypt because his life was threatened by killing an Egyptian. The second order for the killing of every male baby from the Children of Israel was issued by Pharaoh after the Prophet Musa returned to Egypt as a prophet ordered by Allah to awaken Pharaoh and invite him to believe. According to Ibn Kathir, Pharaoh's aim in killing the son of the Children of Israel was to instill dissatisfaction with him among the followers of Prophet Musa himself. Because with the second death threat, it meant that Prophet Musa had caused them two difficulties, firstly when Prophet Musa was not born and secondly after he became a prophet who called on Pharaoh. In Pharaoh's mind, if the Children of Israel were not satisfied with him, then the Prophet Musa would be defeated by his own people. That possibility is narrated in the Qur'an: They (the people of Moses) said, \"We were oppressed (by Pharaoh) before you came to us and after you came.\" (Moses) replied, \"Hopefully your Lord will destroy your enemies and make you caliphs on earth; then He will see how you do.\" (al-A.'raf\/7: 129). However, that aim was not achieved. The second plan to kill the sons of the Children of Israel failed miserably, because Allah sent down various calamities as His punishment, such as the coming of a terrible typhoon, the emergence of attacks by locusts, fleas, frogs, and water that turned into blood (see al-A .'raf\/7:133). The intention to prevent people from believing in the Prophet Musa and the teachings he conveyed also failed, because the truth is impossible to deny and Allah's will must come true as He said: Allah has decreed, \"I and My apostles will surely prevail.\" Truly, Allah is Powerful, Mighty.

He declared to his followers that he himself would carry out the killing and for that he asked not to be hindered. He was sure that he could immediately kill the Prophet Musa. Therefore, he challenged the Prophet Musa to ask his Lord for help. The background to Pharaoh's plan to kill Prophet Musa was his concern that Prophet Musa would exchange the religion of the Egyptian people with the religion of monotheism he taught. Or, he was worried that Prophet Musa would change the beliefs, habits, and customs of his people and would eventually incite his people to rebel against him so that he would lose his power."

Pharaoh's action was motivated by disbelief in the existence of the next day, where every small act will be held accountable. Pharaoh did not believe in the existence of the next day, so he did not believe that if he acts cruelly in this world, he will be rewarded in the hereafter. Such is the result of disbelief.

His name is not clear, but Ibn Kathir narrated from Ibn Abi Hatim that he was the son of Pharaoh's uncle who believed secretly in the Prophet Musa. None of Pharaoh's family believed other than the person mentioned in this verse and Pharaoh's own wife named Asiah. It was this man who told Prophet Musa about Pharaoh's plot to kill him. Thus the history of the source of Ibn 'Abbas. However, al-Khazin, as well as an-Nasafi narrated from Ibn 'Abbas sources that the man's name was Sam'an or Habib. There are also those who call it Kharbil or Hazbil. What the scholars agreed on was that the man was the son of Pharaoh's uncle. The man of faith advised Pharaoh with wisdom, \"Should it be right to kill someone who claims to have faith in Allah, while he has conveyed reasons and concrete evidence about what he believes in?\" He continued that if the Prophet Musa lied, then the consequences of his lies would be borne by himself. However, if the Prophet Musa was right, while he had been tortured or killed, then some of those who were threatened with those who tortured or killed them would be accepted in this world as well, and in the hereafter they would go to hell. He then emphasized that Allah will not guide people who act arbitrarily and lie. That is, Prophet Musa believed and brought proofs of his faith, while those who were arbitrary and deceitful were Pharaohs. Therefore, the one who will not get guidance is Pharaoh. Not getting guidance means that you will be miserable in this world and in the hereafter you will go to hell. Thus those who will be miserable in this world and go to hell in the hereafter are Pharaohs"

Therefore, these blessings must be maintained by believing in Allah, and if they also disbelieve, then it is feared that this greatness will collapse and they will suffer. \"Who will help us when the disaster comes?\" he said. Such was the advice of the believing man to Pharaoh and his people. But the advice was not accepted by Pharaoh. He stated that what he said had to be accepted and implemented, and what he said and ordered was what was good and right. Thus, Pharaoh imposed his will and again acted arbitrarily. Pharaoh's answer was actually not true, because in his heart, he actually confirmed what the Prophet Musa had said. His words were actually only driven by tyranny and arrogance as stated in the following verse: And they denied him because of his tyranny and arrogance, even though their hearts believed in his (truth). (an-Naml\/27: 14) What Pharaoh said that what he ordered his people was good, so that the Prophet Musa had to be killed, was also far from the truth. That's because it's not true that by killing someone the problem will be solved, especially since the one who was killed was an apostle of Allah. The action was actually misguided and misleading, as stated in the following verse: And Pharaoh has led his people astray and did not give guidance. (thaha\/20: 79). However, Pharaoh's followers accepted and obeyed his orders even though they were wrong, as revealed in the following verse: To Pharaoh and the leaders of his people, they followed Pharaoh's orders, even though Pharaoh's orders were not (orders) correct. (Hud\/11: 97) Pharaoh's actions in deceiving his people and forcing them to follow his orders, as well as instigating them to lie to Allah's Apostle, became a lesson for the leaders. Leaders who want to hinder and distance people from the teachings of their religion may suffer the same fate as the Pharaoh. In this case the Prophet gave advice: There is no death of an imam (a leader), where on the day of his death he has deceived his people, but he will not smell heaven. Indeed, the fragrance of heaven can be smelled from a distance of five hundred years of travel. (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim)"

When the apocalypse occurs, the earth shakes violently so that people run here and there screaming for help. However, who will help at that time because every human being experiences the same event and is worried about their own destiny. Regarding yaum at-tanad (the day of calling), there are several opinions of scholars: a. The Day of Judgment, so named because humans at that time screamed for help from others while running here and there watching the earth shake and split apart violently . b. The day when the disbelievers in the hereafter are faced with the hell of Hell, then they are in an uproar running here and there to escape, but the angels intercept and drive them back to Padang Mahsyar to be thrown into hell. c. The day when angels weigh human deeds. If someone turns out to have a heavy scale of good deeds, that person and the people who witness it cheer loudly declare that so and so has good luck, and so on. Likewise, when a person accepts that the scale of his good deeds is lighter than his sins, he also wails bitterly, followed by other people. d. Calls and calls between the inhabitants of heaven and the inhabitants of hell about what each gets. The inhabitants of heaven when asked by the inhabitants of hell whether they have received what God promised them, they answered firmly that they have enjoyed what was promised. On the other hand, when the residents of hell are asked the same thing by the residents of heaven, they also answer with the same words, but with a bitter voice, which shows that what they get is misery. On the day of Mahsyar, which is the day of Allah's judgment, the disbelievers have seen the hell of Hell. Therefore, they ran to avoid it, but the angels intercepted them and returned them to Padang Mahsyar. At that time, no one could help anyone else. Let alone helping others, helping himself is not necessarily capable. The man of faith warned his people that he was very worried that this incident would happen to them. If Pharaoh is what they hope for, then he will be punished in hell, will not be able to help himself, let alone help the other people of his followers. The man of faith asked his people to believe.

However, they still did not want to believe him. They only obey him as a minister or a state official. This shows that they were more affected by the greatness of the worldly position than the position of an apostle, and that's why they preferred the cruel Pharaoh to the prophet Musa who brought the truth. After the Prophet Yusuf died, they declared that after him there would not be any more apostles. They say that because they don't want another apostle to invite them to the truth. It turned out that there was an apostle, namely the Prophet Musa and because of that they disobeyed him and became misguided people. Thus, their error was due to their greed for worldly splendor, as did Pharaoh.

Therefore, people who reject the truth of revelation and believe more in the traditions of their ancestors no longer know what is right and what is wrong. Thus, they are hated by Allah and those who believe. Furthermore, Allah explains His laws for people who close their hearts to receive the truth of revelation, namely that He will close their hearts. Closed hearts happen because they always reject the truth of revelation and make it a problem. Constant rejection will lead to pride. Always questioning the truth will lead to arbitrariness.

Their opinion is supported by the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn 'Umar: That the Messenger of Allah said, \"Indeed one of you when he dies is shown to him his seat morning and evening. If he is among the people of heaven, then (his seat is is) the seat of the people of heaven, if he is one of the people of hell then (his seat is) the seat of the people of hell. It is said to him, 'This is your seat until Allah raises you up on the Day of Judgment.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn 'Umar) From the word of Allah and the hadith above, it can be concluded that the punishment of the grave is a truth that cannot be denied and will be experienced by unbelievers morning and evening until they are resurrected. But ar-Razi stated that the punishment of the grave does not exist. This verse cannot be used as a basis for determining the punishment of the grave, but only points to the continuation of the punishment of hell, similar to the word of Allah addressed to the people of heaven: And therein shall be sustenance for them morning and evening.

They are reluctant to accept the truth because of the influence of lust. They want to be in power and be made leaders in society, and feel they are the most powerful people. Their desire is what causes them to deny the verses of Allah. According to them, this desire will not be fulfilled if they follow the apostle's call, because following the apostle's call means they leave the religion of their ancestors that they have respected so far. Then Allah explained that even though the disbelievers always tried to destroy the Prophet Muhammad and his followers, they would not achieve that goal. Because, Allah always helps the Prophet Muhammad by humiliating, humiliating, and destroying his enemies and their efforts. Allah then ordered the Prophet to always ask for protection from Him to break the deceptions and efforts of the polytheists. Allah is All-Hearing all the requests and supplications of His servants, knows every vibration of the soul and sees all the deeds of His servants. (57) In this verse, Allah presents one of the proofs of the resurrection day on the Day of Resurrection. He explained that creating the heavens and the earth was more \"heavy\" and \"difficult\" than creating humans, both when he first created it and when he repeated it. The heavens and the earth and everything in them are infinite in breadth and magnitude. Countless number of planets there. Countless number of animals and plants that exist in it. The mountains and rivers that flow cannot be traced by humans. The laws and science related to them cannot be known by all humans. Therefore, polytheists should never think that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth and the people in them, is unable to resurrect people on the Day of Resurrection or revive those who have died. Nothing is difficult for Allah, everything is easy for Him. Allah said: And did they not see that it is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and He did not feel bad for creating them, and He has the power to give life to the dead? That's how it is; indeed, He is Almighty over all things. (al-A.hqaf\/46: 33) Verse 57 of this surahh az-Zumar seems to emphasize that the creation of this universe is much more complicated (big) than the creation of humans (this is of course in the view of humans because for Allah nothing is complicated in the slightest ). In fact, from the number of writings resulting from thoughts and findings, the disclosure of the theory of the creation of the universe is more numerous and is developing more rapidly than the development of the theory of human events which until now is still filled with unanswered questions and controversial facts. Judging from the time of its existence scientifically, humans (homo sapiens) are estimated to have appeared 40,000 years ago, this period is nothing compared to the age of the universe which is estimated to have existed since 7 billion years ago, especially when compared to the history of human civilization traces of which were found only about 7000 years ago. It seems that our knowledge about the events of the universe is actually no more than what we know about human events. At the end of this verse, Allah explains the evidence put forward and very few people are willing to think about seeking the ultimate truth. They are too influenced by the desires and pleasures of the world which are only temporary. They also don't want to hear and realize that God is Almighty, nothing can beat Him."

Therefore, resurrecting humans is something that is easy for God. Likewise, those who believe and do good deeds are not the same as disbelievers who always do things that are forbidden by Allah.

(an-Nisa'\/4: 117) In the hadith, the Prophet said: Prayer is worship. (History of at-Tirmidhi from an-Nu'man bin Basyir) Some commentators argue that the prayer in this verse means \"request\". Actually prayer and worship are the same in terms of language. Only the first means special while the second means general. Prayer is a form or way of worship. This is based on the hadith: Prayer is the essence of worship. (Narrated at-Tirmidhi from Anas bin Malik) And the hadith of the Prophet saw: Narrated from 'aisyah, he said, \"The Prophet saw was asked by people, 'Which worship is the most important? He replied,' Someone's prayer for him.\" (Al-Bukhari) Based on the hadith above, the prayer in this verse can be interpreted as worship. This is confirmed by the continuation of the verse which means: \"Indeed, those who are arrogant from worshiping Me will enter a despicable hell.\" This verse is a warning and a strong threat to those who are reluctant to worship Allah. This verse is also Allah's statement to His believing servants so that they will obtain goodness and happiness in this world and the hereafter.

			"tafsir": "Allah commands His messengers to be patient in facing the actions of polytheists who deny and dispute His verses. The apostles were also asked to be patient and put their trust in facing their disturbances and threats. Allah stated that His promise to punish the disbelievers must be true and fulfilled. Allah said to the Prophet that if He showed him, while the Prophet was still alive, the punishment that befell the polytheists, or if he did not show the Prophet that punishment by dying before the punishment came, then that would mean nothing to them. . On the Day of Judgment everything will return to Allah, then they will be rewarded accordingly. Another verse that is synonymous with this verse is: So indeed, if We were to pass you off (before you achieve victory), then surely We will still give them the punishment (in the hereafter), or We will show you (the punishment) that We have threatened them with. So indeed, We have power over them. (az-Zukhruf\/43: 41-42)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that Allah has sent messengers and prophets to people before Prophet Muhammad. Among the prophets and apostles whose stories are described in the Qur'an are 25 apostles, such as Noah, Idris, Abraham, Moses, Sulaiman, Jesus, and other apostles. In addition, many of the prophets and apostles are not mentioned in the Qur'an. It was narrated from Abu Dharr that he said, \"I asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, how many prophets are there? The Messenger of Allah replied, '124 thousand and those who became apostles among them were 315 people. A large number.\" (Ahmad's history) Every apostle sent by God was unable to create miracles on his own, but they could be given by God. The miracle as proof of the apostleship presented to the people who denied it. The form and nature of the miracle were adapted to the circumstances, the time, and the place where the apostle who received it lived, so that the miracle was truly believed by the people at that time. Miracles are given if God himself wills to give them. If Allah has not wished to give it, then the miracle will not be given even if the disbelievers ask for it. The miracle was given in accordance with the wisdom and wisdom of Allah and also in accordance with the benefit of the people. At the end of this verse it is explained that if Allah's punishment has come upon those who deny Him, then Allah will settle their cases in the fairest way possible. Allah saves the apostles and those who believe in him from the punishment, and destroys those who disbelieve and associate partners with Him. This can be seen when Allah's punishment befell the people of 'Ad, Allah saved the Prophet Hud and the believers who were with him. Likewise the doom that befell the Samud and so on."

			"tafsir": "Most commentators are of the opinion that what is meant by livestock in this verse is a camel, because that animal corresponds to the characteristics mentioned in this verse. Ibn Kathir argues that what is meant is camels, cows and goats. Camels are useful for eating, milking, used to transport heavy goods and ridden in traveling. Cows can be used to eat their meat, milk them, and use their energy to plow the land. While goats can be eaten for meat and milked. All of these animals can be used for fur, skin, and hair. Allah's Word: Â¦And He made for you houses (tents) of cattle skins that you feel light (carry) when you travel and when you live and (He also made) of sheep's wool, camel hair , and goat hair, household goods and pleasures until (a certain) time. (an-Nahl\/16: 80) And His words: And He has created livestock, for you there is (fur) that warms and various benefits, and some of it you eat. And you find beauty in it when you bring it back to the stable and when you release it (to the grazing area). And he carries your burdens to a land that you are not able to reach, except with great difficulty. Verily, your Lord is Most Gracious, Most Merciful. (an-Nahl\/16: 5-7) Camels are animals that are mostly used by people who live in the desert, as if camels cannot be separated from their lives and lives. It was the camels that brought them to various countries in trade. Camels are their loyal companions when they are in the middle of a vast desert. Therefore, if the camel is presented by these verses to the Arabs, as one of the most beneficial animals, then the meaning of the parable can be understood by their minds. In the Middle Ages, the Arabs were a nation that connected the West and the East. At that time, there was trade from East to West, bringing spices to the West, and bringing handicrafts to the East. In the East, the spices were brought to South Arabia or to the Persian Gulf, then they were brought to Turkey through the vast desert. The main means of transportation used by the Arabs at that time were camels. In addition to giving examples of the benefits of livestock, namely milk, energy, and so on, this ayat underscores its broad application to transportation, especially in the term ark, which generically means the ark of a ship, meaning a vehicle for sea travel. However, if you see that the Qur'an is the last holy book revealed to mankind until the end of time, then the word ark needs to be expanded to mean all means of transportation, be it at sea, lakes, rivers, swamps or land. This also includes transportation vehicles in the air (atmosphere) or in outer space where there is no air. Therefore, the means of transportation include trains, express trains (shinkansen in Japan), sky lifts (lines) (vehicles that depend and move in the air on a cable, to hovercraft, namely vehicles in marshes or swamps. into it a speedboat vehicle that hovers above the surface of the water and can slide by occasionally touching the surface of the water and moving a few centimeters above it.Into this category there is also a levitation train that is lifted a few centimeters above the rail and does not touch it.Therefore, the vehicle is moves without friction which hinders the movement of the rail. The train can float without touching the rail because it has the same magnetic charge as the rail so that there is repulsion between the train and the rail so that the train levitates as a result moving without touching the surface of the rail so it is free from friction. The series of rides can be revised again with spacecraft such as the samp airplane ai outer space vehicles in the form of rockets and satellites. Of course, this list of vehicles on land, sea and air needs to be revised with the invention of new vehicles in accordance with technological advances, but basically all forms and vehicles used by humans move, move and dynamically to further accelerate the achievement of our goals in life which Allah pleases. ."

Actually they are nomads and travelers who have gone to various countries in doing trade. They went to Yemen, South Arabia and Syria at every season and time, according to the form of trade at that time. On their way through countries that had been inhabited by ancient peoples, such as the land of the people of 'Ad, Samud, the inhabitants of Aikah, Egypt, Babylon, and so on. From the ruins they saw in that country, and the stories they received from their ancestors, they knew that in those countries there had been peoples who were mighty, had high culture, and had conquered the surrounding countries. They chiseled out mountains for their houses, built mighty pyramids, and so on. However, because of the disobedience of Allah's messengers who were sent, Allah's punishment overtook them. At that time, nothing could save them from Allah's punishment. The polytheists of Mecca, who have not been able to match the results achieved by the ancient peoples, will suffer a fate similar to theirs if they continue to deny Muhammad's apostleship. No one can save them from Allah's punishment."

That belief can be covered by circumstances that affect human life. If they are in power, rich, and controlled by their desires, they forget Allah, and even look for other gods to be worshiped, according to the demands of their desires. If they are struck by danger, calamity, sorrow, and so on, they will remember and serve themselves to God who created them. At that time they also denied the gods they invented.

The door of repentance has been closed for them, as Allah said to Pharaoh when he was about to drown: Â¦So that when Pharaoh was about to drown he said, \"I believe that there is no god but God in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of those who Muslims (surrender).\" Why only now (you believe), when in fact you have been disobedient long ago, and you are among those who do mischief. (Yunus\/10: 90-91) This verse warns that faith will benefit a person if he believes in Allah in his life in this mortal world, his mind and heart feel the greatness and power of Allah and he feels that life and death depend on -His. If he made a mistake, he immediately repented and promised not to make a mistake again. What is explained is God's laws that apply to everyone. Faith is useless when they see doom. At that time there is no longer any use of faith and all those who disbelieve will be lost."
