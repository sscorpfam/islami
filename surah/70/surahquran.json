The meaning of the words \"al-ma'arij\" (has a ladder) contained in this verse is that punishment comes from Allah, the Most High and Most Perfect. There is not the slightest deficiency in Allah, and the arrival of doom is solely at His will and decision, not based on the request of creatures, as was done by an-Nadhr bin al-Harith. From this verse it is understood that it is as if the polytheists do not know the glory and greatness of Allah. It is as if to Allah, all their will and desires can be asked, as they do to idols."

			"tafsir": "The angels and Jibril facing Allah takes a very short time and if it is done by humans it will take fifty thousand years. The number of 50,000 years mentioned in this verse is not the actual number, but to explain that the Throne of Allah is very far and high, none of His servants can reach it. Here are several other creatures of God of varying levels and abilities. In another word of God, it is explained that He arranges affairs from heaven to earth in a moment whose level is equal to a thousand years according to human reckoning: He arranges all affairs from heaven to earth, then (affairs) it ascends to Him in one day its measure (length) is a thousand years according to your reckoning. (As-Sajdah\/32: 5) Actually the question is how long this world lasts, and how long it takes for angels to ascend to Allah and then descend back to this world to carry out His commands, including things unseen. Only Allah knows for sure. For us as servants of Allah, it is enough to believe that there is Allah's punishment that will befall those who deny the Day of Judgment. In surahh Az-Zariyat\/51: 7, Allah swears by the sky which has roads. Scientifically, these roads can be interpreted as wormholes, namely shortcuts that connect one place to another in this universe. Then Allah confirms in surahh Al-Ma\\\\'arij\/70: 4 that He has ma'arij, where the angels and Gabriel ascend (facing) to God in a day which is fifty thousand years. As has been explained in the tafsir of surahh Az-Zariyat\/51: 7 that in the physical theory of general relativity, it is known about the mechanism of shortening very long distances to only a few meters which scientists currently call wormholes. These roads may be ma'arij, in which Allah further details that the angels and Gabriel ascended to Allah through these roads and it is described that they ascend in a day which is fifty thousand years. Although no physicist has used it yet, in wormholes we move without the need for energy. As soon as we enter it, the gravitational field pulls us in and suddenly we have been thrown somewhere else. In a wormhole, our watch moves slower and the wand we happen to be carrying shortens as well. However, once out, everything returned to normal, including the clock and stick that we brought. Anyone passing through this ma'arij will experience a dilation of time, that is, a day which is fifty thousand years on earth. It doesn't mean how long we go through ma'arij, but if we go this way we will be older by comparison. The journey of the Prophet during the Isra' Mi'raj, may have gone through a mechanism of shortening the distance so that such a long distance was traveled by the Prophet in just a few hours. When the Prophet told the events that happened to him, the disbelievers clearly did not believe it. Yet it is a sign of the greatness of God. It is interesting to note in surahh Al-Hijr\/15: 13-15: They do not believe in it (the Qur'an) even though circumcision has passed on the former people. And if We open for them one of the gates of heaven, then they continue to climb on it, they will surely say, \"Indeed it is our vision that has been obscured, even we are people who are enchanted.\" (Al-Hijr\/15: 13-15) Allah thus states that for those who do not believe, until the gates of heaven are opened and they pass through them, they will still argue that it is an illusion. SubÂ¥anallah, Allah gives a description of how to arrange His creatures. The angels were passing from place to place by using a special road called ma'arij, and the Prophet, the Beloved of Allah, had the opportunity to go through this ma'arij-special road on a very rocky night, namely Isra' Mi'raj ."

Humans who do not pay attention to God's instructions and the messenger's call are people who are astray. Allah's Word: And most people will not believe even if you really want to. (Yusuf\/12: 103) Humans can go astray from God's way because of their haste, restlessness, and miserliness. This is not a provision from Allah towards them, but they become believers or become disbelievers because of their own efforts and choices. It is He who created you, then among you there are those who disbelieve and among you (also) there are those who believe. And Allah is Seeing of what you do. (At-Tagabun\/64: 2) A straight path is laid out for humans to please Allah and the happiness of life in this world and in the hereafter as conveyed by the Prophet, as contained in the Al-Qur'an and hadith. In addition, there is also a misguided path, a path that is displeased by Allah and leads to a place full of suffering and misery in the afterlife.

Anxiety and stinginess arise in humans because they do not truly believe in Allah. He felt as if he was isolated, that nothing could help him in this predicament. However, when he gets sustenance, he feels that he gets this sustenance solely because of his own efforts, without the help of other people. They think that the sustenance and gifts they get are not gifts from God. Therefore, miserliness arises. It's different with people who believe. He believes that everything that comes to him is a test and trial from God, whether it comes in the form of suffering or pleasure. The trials were given to him to test and strengthen his faith. Therefore, he remains steadfast and patient in accepting all trials, and repents to Allah with real repentance if there is a mistake he has made. On the other hand, if he receives mercy and bounty from Allah, he is grateful to Him and feels himself bound by that grace. Then he took out the rights of other people or the rights of Allah that were in his wealth, as the Prophet Ayub had done: And (remember the story of) Job, when he prayed to his Lord, \"(O my Lord), indeed, I have been afflicted with a disease, even though You Lord, the Most Merciful of all the merciful.\" So We granted him (prayer), then We removed the disease that was in him and We returned his family to him, and (We multiplied their number) as a mercy from Us, and to be a warning to all who worship Us. (Al-Anbiya'\/21: 83-84) A believer will not grieve or give up on world affairs that escape him, and will not affect his soul, because he believes in Qada and Qadar Allah. It is not certain that what is thought to be bad is also bad in the sight of Allah, and what is thought to be good is also good in His sight. Maybe on the contrary, what is thought to be bad is good in the sight of Allah and what seems good is bad in the sight of Allah. He is sure that this is true, because Allah stated in His word: If you don't like them, (then be patient) because maybe you don't like something, even though Allah has made a lot of goodness in it. (an-Nisa\\\\\\'\/4: 19) As for the disbelievers, they do not have such beliefs. They do not believe that the joys and sorrows that God brings to someone are God's trials to him.

When in a happy and joyful state, they only see as if they are the only ones who exist, while the others do not exist, as Allah says: People do not tire of asking for good, and when calamity befalls them, they despair and lose hope. And if We give him a mercy from Us after being afflicted, he will surely say, âThis is my right, and I am not sure that the Day of Resurrection will occur. And if I am returned to my Lord, surely I will get good with Him.\" So indeed, We will inform the disbelievers about what they have done, and indeed, We will inflict a severe punishment on them.

People who believe in the existence of the afterlife are very sure that on that day they will receive the reward of faith and charity that they have done while living in this world. They believe that living in the afterlife is the real life; while living in this world is only a temporary life, to prepare oneself for life in the hereafter. Therefore, all kinds of trials that come to them while in the world, are faced with steadfastness and patience. They never complain, no matter what trials they suffer. Nor will they be stingy to help others who live in poverty and suffering. It has become the basis for the happiness of human life is that his efforts to avoid harm and harm are always greater and take precedence over his efforts to obtain happiness and benefit. However, humans in their daily lives sometimes forget or neglect this basis. He is sometimes quick to be taken in by anything that seems to be doing him good or benefiting him. So do something without taking into account or considering the harm it will cause. As a result he suffers and is miserable. That is the punishment and punishment from God for that negligence. There is a rule of Usul Fiqh which reads: Rejecting harm takes precedence over taking benefit."

God's punishment will only be inflicted on people who do not fear Him.

What reassures the heart of a believer is faith and good deeds that have been done.

The words fa innahum gairu malÂµmÂ³n (then in fact they are not reprehensible) convey the meaning that the right to interfere with one's wife or slaves is not an unlimited right, but must be adapted to religious provisions. According to Islam, the husband and wife relationship is a sacred relationship, a relationship that pleases Allah, a relationship of love, a relationship motivated by the desire to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet, and the desire to have children. Husband-wife relationship has elements of worship. This relationship is described in the word of God: It is lawful for you to fast at night to mix with your wife. They are clothes for you, and you are clothes for them. (Al-Baqarah\/2: 187) Rasulullah SAW said: From 'Abdullah bin 'Amr that Rasulullah SAW said, \"The world is something pleasant, the best property of world life is a pious wife.\" (Muslim History) This verse gives instructions to husbands and wives that in having a relationship with a wife or husband, the master with the slave girl, it should be done in such a way, so that in that relationship there are elements of worship, noble character, good manners, and so on, so as to maintain the glory and dignity as a Muslim.

If a Muslim has been able to have relations with his wife or with his slaves in accordance with the requirements of the Islamic religion, it means that he has mastered the peak of his lust, because the peak of lust lies in relationships such as between men and women. If they have been able to do that, then they will be more able to do other things at a lower level."

In the previous verse, it was explained that one of the conditions for getting rid of complaining and miserliness is maintaining one's honor and glory, namely only by interfering with one's wife or slave. Apart from that, by staying away from actions that can encourage or accelerate people to do prohibited acts, such as promiscuity between men and women, and so on. Therefore, Allah confirms in His word: Say to men who believe, that they guard their eyes, and guard their private parts; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.
