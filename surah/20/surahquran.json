			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains that the Qur'an was sent down not to cause trouble and harm. For the Prophet Muhammad, this verse is as entertainment. It was emphasized that the Qur'an was sent down to him not to make it difficult, nor to be forced on stubborn people, but the Qur'an was sent down to him to be conveyed to his people and to be a warning to them about his misguided actions. If the task of the Prophet Muhammad has been carried out and his da'wah has been carried out, but his people are still disobedient and do not want to obey him, then it is left to Allah, because the Prophet's obligation is only to convey what is his duty, as Allah says: So if they turn away, then know the obligation that is imposed upon you (Muhammad) is only to convey (the message of Allah) clearly. (an-Nahl\/16: 82) Therefore, the Prophet Muhammad did not need to feel anxious, let alone destroy himself because humans did not want to follow his call, as Allah described in His words: Then perhaps you (Muhammad) will harm yourself because grieve after they turn away, if they do not believe in this information (Al-Qur'an). (al-Kahf\/18: 6) Likewise the Prophet Muhammad did not need to feel difficult in conveying the Qur'an to humans, as Allah said: (This is) the Book that was sent down to you (Muhammad); so do not be short of breath over it, so that you may warn with it (the Book) and become a lesson for those who believe. (al-A'raf\/7: 2) Al-Qurthubi explained about Umar bin al-Khaththab's conversion to Islam, at that time Umar bin al-Khaththab entered the house of his brother-in-law Sa'id bin Zaid, he was reading surahh Thaha with his wife Fatimah bint al-Khatthab (Umar's younger brother), and Umar asked for it but was not given it so he got angry and seized the manuscript. When Umar read it, soft and soft heart to accept Islam."

With whichever name you can call, because He has the best names (Asma' ul husna) and do not raise your voice in prayer and do not (also) lower it and try to find a middle way between the two.\".

After obtaining permission, Musa went with his family to Egypt, avoiding the usual roads and taking the road on the slopes, for fear that his family would be disturbed by the king of Syria. In the tafsir of ar-Razi and al-Qurthubi it is stated that after arriving in the Tuwa valley to the west of Mount Tursina, his wife gave birth to a child, on a pitch black, cold night and was lost. In order to warm the bone-chilling cold and get light in the pitch darkness, Musa (as) tried to find fire, but his efforts were not successful. Then unexpectedly, he saw fire from afar on the left side of the road. So he said to his family happily, \"You guys stay here first, I saw the fire from afar, and now I'm going there. Hopefully I can bring the fire here, or get directions from it, to get out of the way.\" this is our way.\" Events like these, are also related in other verses in the Qur'an, as Allah says: So when Musa had finished the appointed time and he set out with his family, he saw fire on the mountainside, he said to his family, \" Wait (here), actually I see a fire, hopefully I can bring you some news from (place) the fire or (bring) a spark of fire, so you can warm yourself.\" (al-Qashash\/28: 29)"

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains that the main revelation and what is conveyed is that there is no true God but Allah and there is no partner for Him, to instill a sense of monotheism, oneness of Allah, confirming confession accompanied by belief and proven by deeds. Therefore only He is the only one who must be worshiped, obeyed His rules. This monotheism, is the essence of all that is essential, and this monotheism is also the first obligation and must be taught first to humans, before other religious lessons. At the end of this verse Allah emphasizes that prayers should be established. Of course, pray in accordance with His commands, complete with its pillars and conditions, to remember Allah and pray to Him sincerely. Salat is mentioned here specifically, to show the superiority of the prayer service compared to other obligatory worship services, such as fasting, zakat, pilgrimage and others. The virtues of praying, among other things, are that when it is carried out as well as possible, in accordance with the rules that have been outlined for it, it will prevent a person from committing heinous and unjust acts, as Allah says: Read the Book (Al-Qur'an) that has been revealed to you (Muhammad) and pray. Verily prayer prevents from (deeds) abominable and unjust. And (know) the remembrance of Allah (prayer) is greater (its priority than other acts of worship). Allah knows what you do. (al-'Ankabut\/29: 45) Some Tafsir experts are of the opinion that the conclusion of this verse, is addressed to people who do not perform their prayers on time, whether due to forgetfulness or otherwise, so that they carry them out when they are aware and remember Allah's abandoned command as the words of Rasulullah saw. Whoever sleeps from the prayer or forgets, then his compensation (gafarat) is the prayer when he remembers. There is no other balance besides that. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas bin Malik) And he also said: If one of you sleeps so he doesn't pray or forgets to pray, let him perform it when he has remembered it, because Allah says, \"And pray in remembrance of Me.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim history from Anas) One of the functions of prayer is to remember Allah, but that does not mean that it is permissible not to pray, it is enough just to remember Allah, because dhikr is done with the heart, mouth and limbs."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains that the Day of Judgment will definitely come, but Allah deliberately keeps it secret and does not explain when the Doomsday will occur. Allah deliberately kept the time of the Day of Judgment a secret so that humans would always be careful and alert and ready to face it. Concealing the arrival of the Day of Judgment is the same as concealing when someone's death will come. No man knows when or where he will die, as Allah says: And no one can know on what earth he will die. (Luqman\/31: 34) If a person knows when his death will come, of course he will do whatever he wants, follow his desires, do all kinds of immorality that he wants. After his death is near then he repents and Allah will accept his repentance according to His promise. Allah will not break His promise, as His word: Truly, Allah does not break promises. (Ali Imran\/3: 9) But if he does not know when his death will come, of course he is always careful, he carries out orders, avoids prohibitions. If he commits immorality, he immediately repents for fear that his death will come suddenly before he repents. So, the purpose of keeping the doomsday a secret is so that people are active in doing good, if a human who is supposed to do good does evil, then that person deserves to be punished. Therefore it is very fair if those who do good are rewarded and those who do evil are punished. Allah's Word: So whoever does an atom's weight of good, surely he will see (reply) it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil, surely he will see (reply) it. (az-Zalzalah\/99: 7-8) And His words: Indeed, you are only rewarded for what you have done. (ath-thur\/52: 16)"

			"tafsir": "When Moses' mother was in a state of panic, she was ordered by God to put her child in a neat and strong box, then throw him into the Nile. This order was carried out by the mother of Moses immediately so that the casket fell into the hands of Pharaoh, the enemy of God and the enemy of Moses himself in the future. It is reported that one evening Pharaoh and his wife were sitting relaxed on the bank of the Nile, when suddenly he saw a chest not far from where he was. He ordered his maids to fetch the chest and bring it before him. When the chest was opened, a beautiful baby boy was seen. How happy Pharaoh's wife saw the baby. The affection and love for the baby is very deep. So he took the baby and nurtured and educated in his palace. This is the first gift. The second gift is that God has bestowed sincere affection on Moses and this love has been instilled in everyone's heart. Anyone who looks at Moses will feel affection for him. So it is not surprising that Pharaoh and his wife felt affection and love for Musa, so that his wife said to her husband, as stated in the Qur'an: And Pharaoh's wife said, \"(He) is a coolness for my heart and for you. Do not kill him. , hopefully he is useful to us or we take him as a child,\" while they are not aware. (al-Qashash\/ 28: 9) The third gift is the upbringing of Musa in the Pharaoh's palace under the supervision and observation of Allah and guarding him from everything that would disturb him, when he was raised by the family of the cruel human Pharaoh who did not know humanity."

			"tafsir": "When Moses was under the care of Pharaoh's family, they were busy looking for women who would suckle him. Every woman who had been appointed to suckle him, Moses would not suckle him. This is a hint from Allah: And We prevented him (Moses) from breastfeeding women who wanted to breastfeed (him) before that. (al-Qashash\/28: 12) Before they found the woman that Musa wanted to breastfeed him, Maryam, Musa's sister, was told by her mother to follow her sister's coffin secretly and offer the Pharaoh's family a woman who would breastfeed Musa and raise him as told in in the word of Allah: \"Shall I show you, a family that will take care of him for you and they can be good to him?\" (al-Qashash\/28: 12) Maryam's offer was well received by Pharaoh's family, so her mother, namely Musa's own mother, was brought in, and Musa followed her to her mother. Thus, Musa was brought back to the care of his own mother and his mother's worries and sorrows disappeared. In fact, how happy she was to see her child safe, fresh and fit. This is the fourth gift. The fifth gift, namely when Moses entered the land of Manuf, the land of Pharaoh, during the day which was quiet because the inhabitants were resting. He saw two people fighting, one from the Children of Israel, namely his group, and the other from the Kibti nation from the Pharaoh's group, in fact he was Pharaoh's cook. When the Children of Israel asked for help, Musa then punched the enemy of the Children of Israel. Unexpectedly, as a result of Musa's fist, the Kibti died. Upon this accidental incident, Musa felt anxious and afraid, as told in the word of God: Because of that, he (Moses) became afraid to be in the city while waiting (due to his actions). (al-Qashash\/28: 18) When the incident became known to Pharaoh, he was very angry and tried to kill Musa. Pharaoh's anger and evil intentions were told to Moses by a member of the Pharaoh's group who had faith in Moses, so Musa went away to escape to the land of Midian. Thus he was saved from Pharaoh's persecution. Moses was not only saved from persecution and murder in this world, but also from the punishment in the hereafter, because the sins of people who kill accidentally have been forgiven by Allah, for his prayers, as told by Allah in His word: He (Moses) prayed, \"O my Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me.\" So He (Allah) forgave him. Indeed, Allah, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. (al-Qashash\/28: 16) Allah gave Musa a succession of trials, to find out how far Musa's mental endurance was, as is usually the case for someone who is prepared to receive the apostles from Allah, but he could pass all of them safely, just as Musa was saved from slaughtering babies en masse by order of Pharaoh, he was saved when he was about to be killed by Pharaoh because he plucked Pharaoh's beard, Moses was defended by Pharaoh's wife on the grounds that he was still small, could not distinguish between good and bad, so Pharaoh's anger subsided and he was saved Moses from the murder of Pharaoh and other trials. This is the sixth gift. The seventh gift is the flight of Moses to Midian, where he stays for a long time, about ten years. At first, he experienced a bitter life among the people of the Madyan country, feeling the pain of living as a foreigner who needed many necessities. In the end, he was forced to become a laborer, herding his father-in-law's goats, in order to get a modest fee, to cover his needs, who was then married to Safura, the daughter of Sheikh Madyan. Thus Moses, until he reached the appointed age, neither more nor less to be made an apostle, that is, when he reached the age of forty."

Indeed, God's rebuke was right for his mistake, because apart from not carrying out God's command as a whole, Moses had left his people without a leader even though there was his brother Aaron who would watch over them. It was as if Moses, because he was driven by a strong desire to do munajat with his Lord, had let go of his responsibility towards his people and no longer cared about what would happen to them while he was gone.

Allah promises will send down the Bible to you, in which there are laws and regulations for your good and happiness in this world and in the hereafter.

Because that was indeed the situation of every apostle, even though books and miracles had been sent down to him to declare the truth of his preaching, his people still denied and tried their best to oppose his call and remained hostile and even wanted to kill him to eliminate him so that the voice of the truth he conveyed was no longer heard. As Allah sent down the Book of Zabur to the Prophet David as, Torah to Prophet Musa as and the Gospel to Prophet Isa as, Allah has sent down the Al-Qur'an to Muhammad, a Book that they deserve well because the teachings contained in it are for their benefit and happiness in this world and in the hereafter. Al-Qur'an is a complete holy book containing various guidelines regarding laws, social relations, economics, morals and so on. Besides that the Qur'an is the greatest miracle for the Prophet. No one can match the beauty of his language and the height of his literature. Therefore, let the Prophet be patient and never give up or be sad, keep fighting until victory is achieved and all evil disappears from the face of the earth, there is nothing worthy of worship except Allah, the One and the Almighty."

Therefore Allah forbade him to act like that, because such an action might mess up his memorization even more because when he repeated reading what had been read to him his attention was focused on repeating the reading not on the next verses to be recited by Jibril even though Allah guaranteed that he would preserve Al-Qur'an as well as possible, so it is impossible for the Prophet Muhammad to forget or to be made by Allah to forget that he first listened carefully to all the verses that Jibril recited, then when Jibril finished reading them all, then the Prophet read them again. This verse emphasizes that Allah is the Most High, the Most Great, the Most Vast in Knowledge, with whose knowledge He regulates everything and makes rules according to the interests of His creatures, including regulations for the safety and happiness of mankind. It was he who sent the prophets and apostles and revealed holy books such as the Psalms, the Torah and the Bible and it was he who revealed the Qur'an to the Prophet Muhammad. The Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad gradually not all at once in accordance with His wisdom. Sometimes only a few short verses or short surahhs were revealed and sometimes long verses were revealed according to the needs and needs of that time. Regarding this Allah said: Do not you (Muhammad) move your tongue (to read the Qur'an) because you want to quickly (master) it. Indeed, We will collect it (in your bosom) and recite it. When We have finished reading it, then follow the reading. Then surely We will explain it.

Why doesn't this all concern them. In fact, if they want to think, there are many lessons and proofs of God's power in those people who have been destroyed, but strangely they don't heed it."

			"tafsir": "Had it not been for Allah's mercy and compassion or for His decree that the rebellious Ummah of Muhammad would not be destroyed like those former nations, and the retribution for their disbelief was postponed until the Day of Judgment, they would surely have suffered destruction as well. This is stated in His word: In fact, the Day of Judgment is the day promised to them and the Day of Judgment is more terrible and more bitter. (al-Qamar\/54: 46) Scholars say that the wisdom in suspending the torment of the ungodly followers of Muhammad until the Day of Judgment is to give them an opportunity to repent or to be among their descendants who believe. It is an honor and glory for the Prophet Muhammad and Allah's mercy and compassion for his people, thus the followers of his teachings will increase in number. This is in accordance with his expectations as mentioned in his words narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abi Hurairah: What was given to me was revelation revealed to me by Allah. So I hope that I will be the Prophet with the most followers among the Prophets. (History of ash-Shaikhan)"

			"tafsir": "Then Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him to remain patient with the actions of his disbelieving people and their ridicule and contempt for him such as accusing him of being a sorcerer, a madman, a poet and so on. In addition, he should always remember and purify God by glorifying and praying before sunrise, before sunset and at midnight. Indeed, by remembering Allah and by praying one can free himself from the confusion of thoughts, sadness and indecision. Prophet Muhammad himself once said about the benefits of prayer to reassure his heart. And make my heart calm when praying. (Ahmad and an-Nasai's history from al-Mugirah) In another verse, Allah commands that to deal with a complicated problem, we should be patient and establish prayer. And ask for help (of Allah) with patience and prayer. And (prayer) is really heavy, except for those who are solemn. (al-Baqarah\/2: 45) In a hadith narrated by Ibn Jarir, the Messenger of Allah said: The Messenger of Allah said: \"Surely you will see your Lord as you see this month, you are not hindered when you see Him. If you If you can try so that you don't miss your prayers before the sun rises and before it sets, then do it.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim) Then the Prophet recited this verse 130. Narrated from Abu Hurairah. The Prophet Muhammad said, \"Allah said, O son of Adam, use your time to worship Me, then I will fill your chest with wealth (inner) and remove your poverty. But if you don't want to do it, I will fill your chest with busyness and will not cover your poverty. .\" (Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi's history) Then Allah said to the Prophet Muhammad saw that if you have done what I have commanded you, namely pray before sunrise, before sunset, and in the middle of the night, surely your soul will be peaceful and serene, and you will be pleased with what Allah has bestowed on you as stated in the verse: And indeed, your Lord will surely give His grace to you, so that you will be satisfied. (adh-dhuha\/93: 5) Regarding this pleasure and inner satisfaction, an authentic hadith reveals the following: The Messenger of Allah said, \"Allah said to the inhabitants of heaven, O inhabitants of heaven. They replied, We are ready to listen to your words O our Lord , safe and happy for You, then Allah says are you satisfied and satisfied? They replied: How can we not be pleased and satisfied You have bestowed upon us the favors that You do not give to other than us among Your creatures. So Allah said, I will grant you something better than that. They asked: What is this, O our Lord, which is better than the bounty we have received? Allah said, Allah said, I will give you My good pleasure, so I will not mad at you after that for all eternity.\" (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah) This is the case if someone who has achieved the pleasure of Allah thanks to his obedience and obedience, to his Lord."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that in order to strengthen the Prophet's heart and strengthen his stance in the face of the struggle to uphold the sentence of Allah, Allah instructed him that he should not divert his attention to the pleasures, luxuries and wealth enjoyed by some disbelievers because it will weaken his enthusiasm if his eyes are dazzled by the glare the jewels of the world and want to have what the rich have. All the blessings given to disbelievers are temporary, like a flower that is blooming, but soon the fragrant flower will wither and fall off its leaves one by one and all its beauty and allure will be lost. The enjoyment of wealth given to disbelievers is only temporary as a test for them, will they thank God with faith and use it to achieve His pleasure or will they remain disbelievers and sink further into error. so that the property becomes the cause of their own accident. Allah has bestowed upon the Prophet in exchange for outward favors better favors, namely peace of mind and happiness in the form of Divine pleasure. Narrated by Abu Rafi', a guest came to visit the Prophet, while there was nothing in his house that should be served to the guest. Rasulullah ordered me to borrow some wheat flour from the Jews and it will be paid later in the month of Rajab. The Jew would not lend unless it was guaranteed. I returned to the Prophet preaching it. The Messenger of Allah said: \"By Allah, I am a person who can be trusted among the inhabitants of the heavens and a person who can be trusted among the inhabitants of the earth. If he lent or sold me, of course I paid for it. Bring this armor of mine. (History of al-Bazzar). Then this verse came down (thaha\/20: 131)."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the next mandate which is no less important than the previous commandment, namely Allah's command to the Prophet to order his family to pray and be patient in carrying out prayers by keeping the time and its continuity. This order was accompanied by the second commandment, namely with a warning that Allah did not ask the Prophet for sustenance, instead Allah would provide sustenance for him, so that the Prophet did not have to think about the sustenance of his family. Therefore, his family should not be affected or be dazzled by the wealth and pleasures possessed by the wives of those who disbelieve. Such is the mandate of Allah to His Messenger as a provision to face a hard struggle, which should be an example for every fighter who wants to uphold the truth on earth. They must first establish a close relationship with their Creator, namely by continuing to pray and strengthening their minds with steadfastness and patience. In addition, the whole household must have the same characteristics as he has. Thus he will be steadfast in fighting not to be swayed by the adornments of worldly life such as wealth, rank and position. These mandates were practiced by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions so that they were truly successful in their struggle so that in a period of approximately 23 years, Islam had developed rapidly throughout the Arabian Peninsula and became the highest and most noble word of Allah. If the Apostle and his family faced various difficulties, he invited his family to pray, as narrated from the sickle, he said: When the Prophet's family is overwritten by trouble, he ordered them, \"Come on, pray, pray,\" the sickle said, \"The prophets if trouble befalls them immediately pray.\" (History of Ibn Abi Hatim)"

			"tafsir": "The Meccan infidels ridiculed the Prophet Muhammad by saying that his appeal to the religion he brought was sheer nonsense. If the religion he brought was true, surely he would prove it with miracles such as that given to the Prophet Saleh, namely the she-camel, that which was given to the Prophet Musa like a staff and that which was given to Jesus, namely bringing the dead back to life and curing hair loss. If they had even a little bit of will to think and inclination to accept the truth they would not have uttered such words, because the Qur'an itself which was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad is his greatest miracle among the miracles given to the prophets before the Prophet Muhammad saw. Various evidences have shown that they cannot imitate the beauty of the arrangement of sentences and vocabulary of the Qur'an, nor can they come up with a single short surahh that is on a par with the surahhs in the Qur'an. Isn't it true that in the Qur'an there are stories about earlier peoples while the Prophet Muhammad himself did not know these stories before. Isn't it that in the Qur'an there are shari'ahs and regulations which have the same aims and objectives as the shariahs brought by the previous Prophets, namely shariahs for the benefit and happiness of mankind in this world and in the hereafter. Actually, the Al-Qur'an alone is enough proof for the truth of Muhammad saw and is enough as a great miracle that is eternal and eternal. Allah deeply regrets the attitude of those who reject the Qur'an just like that without a good reason and don't want to think about it even a little bit. In another verse, Allah also says: Actually, (the Qur'an) are clear verses in the hearts of those who have knowledge. Only those who are wrongdoers deny Our verses. And they (the disbelievers of Mecca) said, \"Why aren't miracles sent down from their Lord?\" Say (Muhammad), \"The miracles are up to Allah. I am only a clear warner.\" Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an) which is recited to them? Indeed, in that (Qur'an) there is a great mercy and a lesson for those who believe. (al-'Ankabut\/29: 49-51)"
