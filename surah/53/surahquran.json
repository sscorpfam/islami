			"tafsir": "Allah swt explains that He swears by His great creatures, namely stars that circulate on their axis, so that they do not collide with each other. The stars are a guide for humans in the forest and in the desert, in residences and on journeys, in villages and cities, and also at sea, the stars are of great use to human life. Allah swt directs His oath to the polytheists in order to know how much the stars are useful for them. Among others, to know the changing seasons so they get ready to graze their livestock, then after it rains they can plant crops according to the season. Allah's oath reminds people that there are mighty objects in space that they must know about so that they can believe in the magnitude of Allah's source of power and the beauty of His creation. Modern science has explained that in the universe there are miracles that can be seen from the speed of circulation and its large shape. The solar realm consists of the sun and 9 planets, most of which are surrounded by several moons. The sun in its nature is part of the universe of space. In the universe there are about 30,000,000,000 (thirty billion) stars. Every star is as sun like the sun of human beings on this earth. Some are bigger and some are smaller than that. The age of the sun is about five billion years, the age of the earth is about 2000 million years. The age of water on earth is about 300 million years. And the human lifespan is about 300,000 years. And the universe has a guardian (only Allah knows). And no one knows the army of God except Him. Al-'Amasy of Mujahid said that this verse refers to the Qur'an when it was revealed as in His words: Then I swear by the places where the stars fly. And indeed it is truly a great oath if you know, and (this) is indeed the very noble Qur'an, in the preserved Book (Lauh Mahfudz), no one has touched it except the servants who are purified. Sent down from the Lord of all the worlds. (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 75-80)"

He is not a heretic who turns away from the truth with a specific purpose. His condition was like that, not only after he was appointed as an apostle, but also before.

This question is a mockery of God, because it is impossible for a reasonable person to have crossed his mind to worship an idol that they made themselves, then put it in a house that they built as a rival to the Kaaba. As for al-Lata, it is the name of a large white stone, on which a stone is carved the image of a house. Al-Lata is located in the Taif area. The house was covered with curtains. Around it there is a terrace that is glorified by the Taif people, including the Saqif tribe and their followers. They are among those who are more proud of this object than other Arabs besides Quraysh. Ibn Jarir said, they thought that the word al-Lata was taken from the pronunciation of Allah. They consider al-Lata (Glory be to Allah from what they say). According to Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Rabi' bin Anas, they named al-Lata after the name of a man who pounded flour for the pilgrims. After he died, people gathered together to perform Itikaf over his grave, which they then worshiped and made a statue of him. According to Ibn Jarir, al-'Uzza comes from the word 'Aziz, al-Uzza is a tree on which there is a building and a curtain, located in Nakhlah, which is between Mecca and Taif; Quraysh people glorify the tree. It is narrated that Abu Sufyan, when he was still a polytheist, said during the battle of Uhud that they had Uzza, while the others did not. So the Messenger of Allah said. \"Say!

			"tafsir": "According to Mujahid and Ibn Zaid, this verse was revealed in the event of al-Walid bin al-Mugirah, he had heard the Prophet's reading and always accompanied him and received advice from him so that his heart was attracted to Islam and the Prophet also hoped for his faith. It so happened that a polytheist who knew about al-Walid criticized him, saying, \"Are you going to leave the religion of your forefathers? Go back to your religion and stick to it! I will bear everything that worries you in the afterlife, in exchange for you giving me something.\" Al-Walid agreed to this invitation, then he withdrew his desire to embrace Islam. Thus he becomes a real heretic and he has surrendered part of the reward he agreed to to the person he promised and withheld the other part. Al-Walid was about to become a believer and followed the instructions of the apostle, then one of the human demons tempted him so that he would not accept the persuasion, and invited him to return to the religion of his ancestors. A person will bear his sins if al-Walid bin al-Mugirah is willing to donate a little of his wealth. He accepted the idea, but he only gave it once, and nothing after that. Does he know something unseen, that his friend can bear the sins he fears on the Day of Resurrection? It was emphasized that the previous Shari'a did not justify the bearing of sins by other people."

From this verse, Imam Malik and Imam Syafi'i understand that it is illegal to give the reward of the living's deeds in the form of reading the Qur'an to the dead, because it was not their actions and their efforts. The same goes for all bodily worship, such as prayers, pilgrimage and recitations, because the Prophet never said this to the people, never ordered it satirically or through texts and neither did his companions convey it to us. If the action was good, they would have done it first. As for alms, the reward goes to the dead, as Muslim and al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Hurairah, that the Prophet said: When a child of Adam dies, all the deeds (which reward him) are cut off, except for three things, children the pious who pray to him, alms jariah (waqf) afterward and the knowledge that can be benefited. (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) In fact, all of this includes a person's efforts, his efforts, as stated in the hadith: Verily, the best that a person eats is the result of his own efforts and that of his children, including his efforts as well. (History of an Nasa'i and Ibnu hibban) Alms jariah like endowments are the traces of their efforts, Allah said: Indeed, it is We who revive the dead, and We are the ones who record what they have done and the traces they (leave). (Yasin\/36: 12) Knowledge that is disseminated then people follow it and practice it, including their business. And has been narrated, among others, an authentic hadith: ÙŽThe one who invites to a clue, he will have a reward similar to the reward of those who follow the instructions, without reducing the reward of those who follow him in the least. (Muslim history) Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and most of the Shafi'i followers are of the opinion that the reward of reading goes to the dead, if the reading is not paid for with wages. But if the recitation is paid for, as is common now, then the reward does not extend to the dead, because it is forbidden to take a fee to read the Qur'an, although it is permissible to take a fee to teach it. Included in acts of worship whose rewards reach other people are prayer and alms . ("

He was the ruler of the Arab nation, so that the Quraysh said that the Prophet Muhammad was the son of Abu Kabsyah, as a similarity because he differed in terms of the principles of his religion from the religion of their ancestors. Abu Kabsyah is one of the Prophet Muhammad's grandmothers, from his mother's side. As Abu Sufyan said when he was in the presence of Heraclius who became the Roman Magister, \"There has really become a big problem with this son of Abu Kabsyah (the Prophet). Among the Arabs there are those who worship the stars and acknowledge their influence on the universe and they talk about the problem -problems that are unseen when the star rises.
