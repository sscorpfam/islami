			"tafsir": "Allah swears by the warhorse that makes its roaring sound. Horses that had sparks shooting from their hooves from running fast. The horses that attack at dawn to ambush the enemy when they are caught off guard. Because of the horse's running fast, the dust was flying. Allah stated that the attacking horse was suddenly in the midst of the enemy causing them to panic. Allah swears by the horse and its characteristics in a war situation aims to arouse the spirit of struggle among the believers. It is only fitting that they are of this nature by getting used to riding agile horses to attack the enemy. They are also ordered to always be ready to jump into battle when the drums of war call them to destroy the attacking enemy, as Allah says: And prepare with all your might to face them with the strength that you have and from cavalry that can terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy. (al-Anfal\/8: 60). God swears by the warhorse galloping, to and fro, shooting sparks from its legs for galloping, and by the ambush at dawn, showing that the horses were not kept for pride. Let the horse that is praised be used to quell the ferocity of the enemy, paralyze their strength, or block their attacks. That is, in equestrian dexterity contained innumerable benefits. Among them are that it can be used to earn a living, move quickly for a sudden need, be used to ambush enemies, and can reach distant places in a short time."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah explains the contents of His oath, namely: human nature is to deny the truth and not acknowledge things for which they have to be grateful to their Creator, except for those who are taufik, get used to doing good and abstain from evil. The connection between verse 5 which describes the horse problem and verse 6 which provides information about human nature is that man has the potential to run wild like a horse that is out of control, causing him to disobey God. This hidden nature in the human soul causes it to not care about what is around it, not to care about what is to come, and to forget what has been in the past. When Allah grants him a favor, he becomes confused, his heart becomes violent, and his attitude becomes harsh towards Allah's servants."

He admitted that he was not grateful for the favors of Allah bestowed upon him. He also admits that all his actions are against and denial of these favors. This is his own testimony of his denial, the confession is stronger than the confession that comes from himself verbally."
