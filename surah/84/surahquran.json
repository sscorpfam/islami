Therefore, the order of the universe was broken and there were dark clouds that appeared in several places in outer space, and the sky would obey whatever God commanded. He deserves to be obedient because he is God's creature who is always in His power."

			"tafsir": "Furthermore, Allah explained that if the earth and mountains were crushed into pieces so that they became flat and released what was in their \"stomach\", then this was due to their submission to Allah's commands and obedience to do His will. In other verses, Allah says: When the earth is shaken with a violent shock, and the earth has released its heavy burdens (which it contains). (az-Zalzalah\/99: 1-2) And when the graves are dismantled. (al-Infithar\/82: 4) So doesn't he know when what is in the grave is taken out. (al-'Adiyat\/100: 9) For the tafsir of the sentence \"the sky split asunder\" above, it can be seen again in the scientific study of surahh al-Insyiqaq\/84:1-5, see also the scientific study of surahh al-haqqah\/69:16 and surahh al-Infithar\/82:1. Then, the sentence that follows: \"¦and obeys his Lord, and naturally the heavens obey\", implies that the incident took place according to sunatullah, that is, according to Allah's laws that exist in this universe. The definition of \"the earth was flattened, and spewed out what was in it and became empty\" is that the earth was completely destroyed, either in a collision with a planet or other celestial body, due to the loss or confusion of the gravitational force. The melting of the earth's desolation also causes the entire contents of the earth to vomit and makes the contents of the earth empty. Then, the sentence that follows: \"¦and obeys his Lord, and the earth should obey\", implies that the incident took place according to sunatullah, that is, according to Allah's laws that exist in this universe."

The Messenger of Allah replied, \"An easy reckoning is when Allah checks a person's deeds, He forgives. O 'Aisyah, the person who is interrogated on the calculation of his deeds on that day (Doomsday), then he is wretched. And every calamity that befalls a believer, Allah will forgive (his sin) with that disaster, even if it's just a thorn.\" (Ahmad's history) The meaning of the Messenger of Allah with an easy calculation was that all his mistakes were forgiven, while a person whose records were examined carefully was a person who received a disaster. Whoever gets an easy and light calculation, he will return to his believing family happily as Allah says: As for the person whose book is given in his right hand, he said, \"Take it, read my book (this).
