			"tafsir": "Al-Quran is the holy book that was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, and does not contain things that can doubt the truth of people. The truth of the Al-Quran covers all aspects contained in it such as law, Shari'a which are shalih fi kulli Zaman wa Makan (suitable for all ages and in all places), various parables, stories, and instructions that must be followed by humans to achieve happiness in this world and the hereafter. The truth of the Quran was proven in the early days of Islam. By adhering to the Al-Quran, Muslims are able to build a nation that is highly cultured and has noble character. The Al-Quran motivates people to rise up to fight for the truth, destroy evil, uphold justice, and eliminate tyranny. By carrying out the instructions of the Al-Quran, Muslims can become an authoritative nation. But when the Koran was abandoned, Muslims chose the world over the eternal hereafter, and as a result of Muslims' disbelief in God's promises contained in the Koran, Muslims turned into a backward nation, entangled in poverty and ignorance. If today's Muslims do not realize their mistake and do not try to correct it, by re-implementing the messages of the Koran, then Muslims will continue to fall into their ignorance. Allah will not change their destiny if they do not change their own destiny. Word of Allah swt.: Surely Allah will not change the condition of a people before they change the condition of themselves.

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the proofs of the truth of the Koran by presenting signs or evidence of the existence of Allah who sent down the Koran. The existence of Allah is proven by the various creations that humans can see and feel in this universe. In detail Allah explains the condition of the heavens that are raised up without pillars, the journey of the sun and the moon which each circulates according to a predetermined time and place, the condition of the earth which is full of mountains and valleys with rivers flowing between them, and the existence of various gardens that produce wide variety of fruits. All of this shows that only Allah can benefit and harm, who can give life and death and is the Almighty over all things. The signs of Allah's power in the sky are described in this verse: 1. Creating heavens above the earth without any pillars as is commonly seen by all creatures, and great distances between objects in the sky, all of which circulate according to Allah's rules and regulations themselves like objects seen floating in space. 2. Then Allah resides on His Throne and governs this universe. About His wisdom has been explained at length in surahh al-Araf and surahh Yunus. 3. Allah swt has subjected the sun and the moon for the benefit of all His creatures, each running on its rotation \/ trajectory according to the specified time. About the journey of the sun and the moon has been explained in detail in surahh Yunus and surahh Hud. Allah swt regulates all events in His kingdom perfectly, He is the one who gives life and death, creates and annihilates, gives wealth and poverty, sends down revelation to whom He wills. All of this shows that it is Allah who has absolute power and extensive grace, because it determines the creation of a creature with a certain nature and character, which cannot be carried out except by the Almighty and Almighty God. It is He who rules the material and spiritual realms and He who rules things that are very large and very small, all with great wisdom. From a scientific point of view, the sky or sama in this verse can mean the blue sky or the atmosphere that is close to this earth. In a broader sense, the same can also be interpreted with this vast expanse of space. The atmosphere is the gaseous envelope that covers a planet (including Earth). It forms an air space. The atmosphere is divided into 6 (six) regions according to their height, one above the other. Sequentially from the lowest region, the atmosphere is divided into: (1) Troposphere (Troposphere altitude: 0-8 Km), (2) Tropopause, altitude: 8-12 Km (3) Stratosphere (Stratosphere, altitude: 12-80 Km ), (4) Mesosphere (Mesosphere, altitude: 80 Km) (5) Ionosphere (Ionosphere, altitude: 100 Km) and (6) Exosphere (Exosphere, altitude >100Km). The occurrence of clouds, weather and so on is in the Tropospheric region. The composition of the atmosphere (in the troposphere), the majority consists of nitrogen gas (78%), also oxygen (20%). This atmosphere covers the earth and can be upright above the earth because of the earth's gravitational force. This is the meaning of lifting up the sky without the pillar. Of course this is a different tafsir of the heavens from the seven layers of heaven which concerns galaxies and so on. With regard to the sky without pillars, from a structural point of view, a structure without pillars is only possible if the construction is spherical or similar to a ball (spherical, surface of revolution), although experts have not agreed on its shape; some claim it as a ball, like a saddle, even as a trumpet. In this construction the walls and columns are fused to form the spherical surface itself. So, the construction of a sky without pillars is only possible if the sky is in the shape of a ball, according to scientific findings which state that the universe is a large ball that expands and expands at the speed of light, that is, with the speed of light 300 thousand kilometers per second (the expanding universe). The sky-space, indeed, was formed since the Big Bang and continues to expand and expand. In surahh az-zariat\/51:47 it is stated: And the sky We built with power (We) and We really expand it. The same word in verse 47 of surahh az-zariat\/51 above is more precisely interpreted as sky-space. The outer space (space) is constantly expanding (space expansion). Research on the spectrum of the Galaxy, shows that there is a regular shift of the red-band spectrum, this explains that the distances between the Galaxies are getting further away, and this is an indication that the sky-space is expanding. Of course this sky does not need pillars; because it was built with the all-powerful power of Allah SWT in the form of a Big Bang. This Big Bang has broken the Superforce Force into Fundamental Forces such as: Gravitational Force, Strong Nuclear Force, Weak Nuclear Force, and Electromagnetic Force; all of which stabilize this space-sky. Then in these verses it is stated: \"He has subjected the sun and the moon; each goes around according to an appointed time\". The word \"subject\" means that both the sun and the moon are subject to sunatullah, or natural laws from Allah. Regarding \"each circulation according to a specified time\", see the information in surahh Yunus\/10: 5 above. This is an explanation from a scientific point of view. All of this happened thanks to the perfection of Allah in His substance, nature, knowledge, and power which cannot be imitated by anyone. Allah regulates the affairs of His creatures, explains His signs with very neat and perfect regulations, and arranges the objects in the sky so that they run according to a predetermined trajectory, such as the shape of a chain that connects together so that there are no collisions in space. space that can cause havoc and disaster. All of this continues until the Day of Judgment comes, when there will be chaos and disorder in the work of the heavenly bodies in space. The destruction of the universe begins with the splitting of the heavens, as explained in God's word: When the heavens are split open, and when the stars fall and scatter. (al-Infithar\/82:1-2) Then Allah explained that the signs of the perfection of His power in the heavens and on earth are a means that can give rise to mankind's belief that there will be an encounter with Allah, the Creator on the Day of Resurrection, where He will reward those who do good and punish those who do evil. If man believes in this truth, surely he can turn away from worshiping idols and statues to the sincerity of worshiping only Allah Almighty, believing in His promises and threats, believing in all of His messengers, following all commands and avoiding His prohibitions, so that they become happy human beings in this world and in the hereafter."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains the other side of the signs of His power in the earth, namely: 1. He is Allah who spreads the earth wide and wide so that it is easy for His creatures to live in. All animals can live on it freely. Humans can benefit from the produce of their land, animals, and metal objects hidden in their stomachs, and can roam the earth in search of sustenance and all its benefits. Because it is so vast, this earth looks like a flat land, although its actual state is spherical as believed by the scholars of astronomy. 2. Allah has made mountains above the surface of this earth as pillars and pegs that keep the earth stable so that it does not move and does not shift. 3. Allah has created rivers on earth for the benefit of humans and animals. Humans can irrigate with river water their gardens and rice fields which will produce various kinds of crops and fruits. 4. Flowers from fruit trees are made by Allah in pairs where there are male and female elements. Science has determined that a tree will not bear fruit unless there has been a marriage between the male (pollen) and female (pistil) elements which are usually present in most of the tree species. There are trees that only have male elements, while the female elements are present in other trees, so they need to be mated so that they can bear fruit like date palms. There are also those that have male and female elements in one flower such as the cotton tree. 5. Allah closes the night to the day so that the bright natural atmosphere turns into pitch darkness like covering something with a black cloth. Likewise, Allah makes the day shine on the night so that the darkness disappears and nature looks bright. All of this was made by Allah to perfect the benefits for humans by giving them the opportunity to rest and sleep at night and work for a living during the day according to the word of Allah: Have they not seen that We have made the night for them to rest in it and (made) a day that illuminates ? (an-Naml\/27: 86) In verse 3 above, it is explained that Allah closes the night to the day. In another verse it is also stated that the night closes the day and the day closes the night. The words used in Arabic are similar to a person wearing a turban, that is, one piece of cloth covers the other and covers the head in layers. Thus the word closing the night to day, actually implies that our planet Earth is round; not as flat as the old ignorant people portrayed it. After Allah explains the arguments for His power which can be seen by the eye every morning and evening, every time and condition, then Allah explains that these signs are not noticed except by people who like to be grateful and reflect on the signs of power. -His. Then with his mind he can reach the truth and move from looking at the cause to the cause. Indeed, in that there are signs of Allah's greatness for people who want to think that the creator of nature is God who has an absolute will and power that encompasses all things, who has the power to revive those who have died among His creatures, and bring them back to life. from the mortal realm. Therefore, it is not permissible to worship except to Him, it is not permissible to submit and surrender except to His authority. Worship should not be directed at statues, idols, stones, trees, angels, prophets, and so on because these objects cannot resist harm from themselves, according to the word of God: Verily, all that you exclaimed besides Allah could not create even a single fly, even though they united to create it. And if the fly takes something from them, they can't get it back from the fly. (al-hajj\/22: 73) And it has also been narrated in a hadith of the Prophet. Think by all of you about God's creatures and don't think about God. (Narrated by Abu Nuaim from Ibn Abbas)"

			"tafsir": "The expression of this verse is a continuation of the signs of Allah's power in the earth, namely that in the earth there are parts of land that are close together and side by side but differ in fertility. There is soil that is very fertile for planting any type of crop, there is also land that can only be planted with large trees, but it is not good for growing crops or vice versa, there is also soft soil and some hard soil which is difficult to loosen. On earth there are vineyards, crops, and trees that branch and do not branch. All of this is poured with the same water but produces fruit of various tastes, such as sugarcane trees that taste sweet, citrus fruits that taste sweet and sour, and bitter pariah fruit, and so on. Allah exalts some plants over some others both from their shape, taste and smell. All these signs show the power of Allah and become arguments that can give rise to confidence for people who want to think. According to scientific studies, the difference in taste of fruits or plants is due to differences in the chemical content in them. These chemical substances or molecules, in the language of biochemistry, are known as metabolites. The difference in the type and quantity of these metabolites gives a different taste from different plants or fruits. The seeds of all plants, almost all of them have the same shape or are known to have the same morphology, or almost the same, that is, the morphology is round or slightly oval. All these seeds contain plant embryos within them (Encyclopedia Britannica, 1965,Vol.20, Seed, 273-275). The plant embryo contains genetic material (or what is often called DNA, Desoxyribo Nucleic Acid, or Desoxyribo Nucleic Acid). In the seeds of different plants, the embryonic content is different, as is the content of the DNA material. DNA is a material that will greatly determine the process of forming metabolites in all living things, including plants. So Almighty Allah, if different seeds are planted and watered with the same water, those seeds will grow into various plants with different tastes, depending on the genetic material they contain; because it is this genetic material that will determine (make) the metabolites in the plant that determine the taste of the fruit or plant."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the attitude of disbelievers towards the oneness of Allah, where Allah told the Prophet Muhammad that if he was surprised at their worship of idols that did not harm and bring benefits after the arguments for the oneness of Allah were put forward, then what is even more surprising is their words. who deny the day of resurrection on the Day of Resurrection. They said, \"When we have become the ground will we really be returned again to become new creatures?\" They say the words of denial even though they do not deny the power of Allah in creating them since they were in their mother's womb. The question that contains denial is repeatedly mentioned in eleven places in eight surahs in the Koran, namely surahh ar-Rad\/13: 5, al-Isra\/17: 49 and 98, al-Muminun\/23: 35 and 82, an-Nahl\/16: 38, as-Sajdah\/32: 10, ash-shaffat\/37: 16 and 53, al-Waqiah\/56: 47, and an-Naziat\/79: 11. All of them contain a very strong denial that suggesting that the day of resurrection is impossible to happen. According to them, it is impossible for people who have died and become bones to come back to life. Then Allah confirms that those who disbelieve on the Day of Resurrection are also those who deny their Lord. To deny God's power is to deny God himself. They will have shackles placed around their necks as a result in the world of not believing in the truth and following instructions. There are also those who interpret that they are on the Day of Resurrection when they are tried and put several shackles around their necks like a prisoner. God's Word: When the shackles and chains were put on their necks, as they were dragged, into very hot water, then they were burned in the fire. (al-Mumin\/40: 71-72) They are the eternal inhabitants of hell in it and live in humiliation as a result of their denial and evil while living in the world. Allah swt with His omnipotent nature, is able to create everything that exists in this world, both living and moving, and dead, even from nothing to exist. Therefore, Allah will easily resurrect people after death. Allah's Word: ... he said, \"Who can revive the bones that have been crushed? Say (Muhammad), \"The one who will bring them to life is (Allah) who created them first... (Yasin\/36: 78 -79) Allah's Word: Does man think that We will not collect (back) his bones? (In fact), We were able to rearrange his fingers perfectly. (al-Qiyamah\/75: 3-4)"

			"tafsir": "After denying the Apostle and denying the doomsday doomsday, they also deny the doom in the world that the Messenger of Allah had threatened them with. They asked him to hasten the torment that had been threatened upon them. They should ask for goodness and safety from the punishment and hope for the reward promised by the Prophet in the afterlife. Whereas various punishments have been inflicted by Allah on those people who denied the previous apostles. Some of them were changed in appearance and character to become like monkeys, some were destroyed by an earthquake, and so on. Regarding the situation of those who prefer to challenge the punishment rather than asking for good it is also mentioned in the word of Allah: And (remember), when they (the polytheists) said, \"O Allah, if this (Quran) is true (revelation) from You , then shower us with stones from the sky, or bring on us a painful punishment.(al-Anfal \/ 8: 32) Verily Allah has wide forgiveness for the sins of His servants who repent and cover up their mistakes in the Day of Judgment. If Allah were not forgiving, surely Allah would torture people because of their tyranny. The Word of Allah: And if Allah were to punish people for what they have done, surely He would not leave even a single moving creature alive on this earth. (Fathir\/ 35: 45) Indeed, Allah's punishment is very painful for those who do evil and continue to wallow in error and sin. There are some punishments that will be hastened upon the world as a result t from various sins, such as disturbing the health of people who used to drink liquor, bankruptcy of people who like to gamble even though they were previously rich, and a corrupt person who was removed from a high position because he was involved in corruption and manipulation. Very often forgiveness from Allah is mentioned side by side with torment so that a servant of Allah is always in a middle position between khauf and the king (fear of Allah's punishment and hope of obtaining His forgiveness) as in Allah's word: Indeed, your Lord is very quick to punish Him, and verily He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained how the disbelievers said to the Prophet Muhammad in a challenging tone why he was not sent down to him a sign of greatness from his Lord such as a staff as a miracle given to Prophet Musa and camels to Prophet Saleh, and why Muhammad could not turn the hill of Safa into gold or turning these hills into valleys with flowing rivers. They claim this because they think that the Koran is not a miracle. Allah swt has rejected their demands with His words: And there is nothing that prevents Us from sending (to you) signs (Our power), but because (signs) have been denied by the former. (al-Isra\/17: 59) The applicable sunatullah is if the signs of Allah's power have been requested, and after the signs are revealed, but those who demand them remain disobedient and do not believe, surely they will be annihilated by Allah's punishment. God does not want that so that he does not send down signs of miracles as they demand. The Prophet Muhammad was given another miracle to prove the truth of his message. The main task of the Prophet Muhammad was just conveying his message like the duties of the previous prophets, not fulfilling the suggestions and requests of his people so that they would receive guidance. The matter of giving directions to someone's heart is only in the hands of Allah and is not the authority of the Prophet Muhammad, as explained in the word of Allah: It is not your (Muhammad's) obligation to guide them, but it is Allah who guides whom He wills. (al-Baqarah\/2: 272) Truly the Prophet Muhammad was only a warner. For every people there is a leader who gives instructions to goodness. They are the prophets and when they are gone, then the wise men, scholars, and mujtahidin will continue the prophet's work to explore and explain the Shari'a in more detail which contains elements of good morals and life guidelines for mankind.

(an-Najm\/53: 32) Allah knows that the uterus is imperfect, where the baby has defects. Allah knows the wombs of twins, triplets, quadruplets, or more, and those whose gestational period is nine months complete, less than that, or more.

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that Allah swt assigns several angels to always follow people in turn, in front of them and behind them. They guarded it at the command of Allah. There are angels who are in charge of guarding humans at night, and there are those who are in charge during the day, guarding against various dangers and harm. There are also angels who record all human deeds, good or bad, namely angels who are on the right and left. The angel on the right records all the good deeds, and the one on the left records the bad deeds, and two other angels, one in front and one behind. Each person has four angels, four during the day and four at night. They come in turn, as explained in an authentic hadith: There are angels who take turns guarding you at night and during the day. They met (to hold the handover) during the Fajr and Asr prayers, then the angels who guarded the night went up to Allah Taala. He asked, while He already knew what he would ask, \"How were My servants when you left them (in the world)?\" The angels replied, \"We came to them while praying and we left them, and they were praying.\" (Al-Bukhari history from Abu Hurairah) If a human knows that there are angels by his side who record all his deeds and supervise them, then he must always protect himself from immoral acts because the angels will see his every activity. Angel supervision of human actions can be trusted after science has created modern tools that can record all events that occur to humans. For example, measuring devices for the use of electricity and drinking water in each city and village have been arranged in such a way that it can be seen how much has been used and how much the user has to pay. The same goes for tools installed in motorized vehicles that can record their speed and measure how far they have traveled. The development of science that can reveal various unseen matters, as evidence that can give us confidence about the correctness of the theory of religious provisions. This is also a reason to convince people who are controlled by material doctrine, so that they admit that there are supernatural things that cannot be felt and known only with the five senses. Therefore, it is really appropriate for people to say that the position of religion and knowledge in Islam is like two inseparable twins, or like two friends who are always together side by side and do not argue with each other. The angels guard humans at the behest of Allah and His permission. They carry out the task perfectly. Just as in the material realm there is a close relationship between cause and effect, according to wisdom, such as the existence of eyelids that can protect the eyes from objects that may enter and can damage them, so also in spirituality, Allah has assigned several angels to guard humans from various harms and temptations of lust and demons. Allah swt has assigned the angels to record human deeds even though we don't know how they record them. We know that actually Allah Himself is sufficient to know it, but why did He still assign angels to record it? Maybe it contains wisdom so that humans are more submissive and careful in their actions because God's omniscience surrounds them. Their deeds are accurately recorded so that later no one will feel wronged in Allah's judgment. Ali bin Abi Talib said that there was no servant but an angel who guarded him from falling walls, falling into wells, being eaten by wild animals, drowning, or burning. However, when certainty comes from Allah or when death comes, they allow people to be overwritten by disasters and so on. Allah will not change the state of a nation from the pleasures and prosperity it enjoys to perish and miserable, but they themselves change it. This is caused by acts of persecution and mutual enmity, as well as doing corruption and sin on earth. Hadith Rasulullah saw: If people see someone who is unjust and does not act against him, then it is very possible that Allah will send down punishment that hits them all. (History of Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah from Abu Bakr ash-shiddiq) This statement is strengthened by the words of Allah: And protect yourself from the torment that does not only afflict those who are unjust among you. (al-Anfal\/8: 25) The Muslims in the first phase of the spread of Islam followed the teachings of the Koran with full confidence and awareness, so that they became the best people among humans. They controlled various prosperous areas at that time, and defeated the Roman and Persian empires by exercising wisdom in a just government, and witnessed by their enemies. People who are persecuted are defended in order to uphold justice. Therefore, Islam has been recognized as an absolute element in fostering national character and state development. After their generations passed and were replaced by generations that came later, it turned out that many neglected religious teachings about justice and truth, so that their situation turned into a despicable nation. Whereas before that, they were a nation that was honorable, dignified, noble, and respected by friends and foes alike. They became a nation that was enslaved by the colonialists, even though they were previously the rulers. They have become a nation that follows, even though they used to be a nation that led. Ibn Khaldun in his Muqaddimah has included a chapter with the title: Tyranny can Destroy Prosperity. He pointed out several examples in history before and after Islam, that tyranny destroys the power of the Muslim community and lowers its rank, so that it becomes the undermining of all nations. The once victorious Islamic ummah slumped for several centuries under the rule and colonialism of the West. If Allah wills bad for a people with sickness, poverty, or various other trials as a result of the bad deeds they have done, then no one can refuse them and there is absolutely no protector for them besides Allah."

			"tafsir": "He is the God who shows lightning, which creates fear of being struck by lightning for people who are in nature or traveling. But sometimes the lightning and thunder raises hope for other people, such as farmers who expect rain to irrigate their fields and fields. Likewise everything in this world is sometimes seen as good because it is needed at certain times, and sometimes it is seen as bad considering the harm it might cause. Allah also creates clouds that contain rainwater and because of their weight, these clouds pour onto the surface of the earth to become rain. According to scientific studies, the formation of clouds (thunder-clouds), lightning, thunder, and lightning, as revealed in the Koran, was believed by many scientists from the start to be a natural phenomenon that has a close relationship with the process of rain and or storm events. that often occur on the surface of the earth. This phenomenon is one of the signs of Allah's power and might. Indeed, not all types of clouds can bring rain. Clouds that can cause rain are clouds of the cumulonimbus type. According to scientists, the clouds that form will produce a separation of positive and negative charges (electricity). Positive charges generally gather at the top of the cloud, while negative charges gather at the bottom of the cloud. The charge will flow in various ways such as between charge pockets in the cloud, from the cloud to the earth, released through the air as a flow of electrostatic charge, and jumps into the ionosphere. These giant jumps of sparks are known as thunderbolts, thunderbolts or thunderbolts. As a result, the air is split open, the strike, which has a speed of up to 150,000 km\/sec, will cause a thunderous sound which we usually call rumbling, thunder, thunder, thunder, and so on. This thundering sound shrinks the hearts of humans who hear it and the impact can often be deadly to humans. This is what is meant by \"frightening lightning\". Benjamin Franklin (1752) succeeded in proving that lightning is a very large electric discharge. From the results of the research, it is known that the minimum electric field that allows the trigger of this lightning is around 1,000,000 volts per meter. Under certain conditions, the earth, which tends to act as a damper for static electricity, can also interact. It is possible for the concentration of positively charged electricity to occur due to the difference in charge between the cloud base and the earth's surface. What happens then is the transfer of electric charge. So physically we will see lightning strikes with such a large electric charge, then they will immediately spread to the surface of the earth which then spreads into the ground and finally neutralizes at depths containing groundwater. The place where this transfer of electric charge occurs often causes disaster and damage. This is commonly known as being struck by lightning or thunder. From other observations, it is known that lightning has benefits for the earth and humans. Lightning is a natural process that produces the nitrogen element needed by plants and fills about 4\/5 of the earth's atmosphere, even lightning also functions in the global electrical circuit. Giant lightning flashes are believed to be able to help balance the global circuit of electricity between Earth and space and also concentrate in the formation of ozone. In addition, that sparkling lightning can produce mushrooms. According to research in Japan, shiitake mushrooms can thrive if the seeds sown are given an electric jump around, which is the same as the effect of lightning. This is based on experience that after yesterday afternoon there was lightning, the next day there were lots of mushrooms growing around it. In addition, the length (strength) of lightning can predict the rainfall that will fall the next day. This is an explanation from a scientific point of view."

			"tafsir": "The thunderous sound emitted by lightning due to a very large electrical jump according to the Koran is his tasbih recitation in praising Allah. This is a sign of his submission to Allah, purifying Him from communion and revealing his weakness compared to the power of his Most High and Supreme Creator. Every thing that makes a sound, the sound means tasbih, it's just that humans don't understand the language: And there is nothing but glorifies Him by praising Him, but you don't understand their tasbih. (al-Isra\/17: 44) When we hear thunder and lightning, we are circumcised to recite a prayer, as the hadith of the Prophet narrated by al-Bukhari, Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasai from Ibn Umar, that the Prophet Muhammad saw when he heard the sound of thunder and lightning he recited: O Allah, do not kill us with your anger, do not destroy us with your punishment, and give us health before that. Ibn Mardawaih narrates a hadith from Abu Hurairah as follows: That the Messenger of Allah, when there was a strong blowing wind, or heard thunder, the color of his face changed, then he said to the thunder, \"Glory to the Substance, the thunder glorifies Him.\" And to the wind he said, \"O Allah, make the wind a mercy and do not make it a punishment.\" Likewise the angels glorify because they fear Allah and praise Him. Allah releases lightning, then hits whom He wills and destroys them. However, they still argue about the attributes of Allah that have been explained by His messengers, such as: His perfect knowledge, power, oneness, and His provisions revive humans on the Day of Resurrection to bring them to account on the Day of Judgment and retribution. In this verse, Allah swt told the Prophet to be patient with the denial of polytheists who demanded that he bring miracles such as the staff of Moses, the miracle of Jesus, and others. In fact, the Koran itself is the greatest and eternal miracle of all time, no one can imitate it. Allah told the Prophet to be patient because they had exceeded the limits to the point of denying the Lordship of Allah and His Oneness, making partners for Him, saying that Allah has a child, and denying the existence of the day of resurrection and vengeance. In this way, Allah swt reassured the Prophet's heart so that he would not dissolve in sorrow in facing all these challenges, and stated that He is God the Most Severe (His torment), as stated in His words: And such is the torment of your Lord when He tortures (people) unjust countries. Truly, His torment is very painful, very heavy. (Hud\/11:102)"

			"tafsir": "This verse makes it clear that only God has the authority to grant true prayer. There are also those who interpret: only to Allah is the true appeal regarding monotheism, purity, and sincerity in worship. The idols worshiped by the polytheists cannot grant their request in the slightest. Asking something to an idol is like someone who wants to drink, but only by opening his palms into the water. He hoped that the water would rise itself into his mouth. Even though the water would not be possible to enter by itself into his mouth without first being collected with the palms of both hands. Likewise the idols they worship, let alone fulfilling the requests of their worshipers, even if they are asked they cannot answer. The prayers and worship of the disbelievers to idols are only in vain. When they pray to Allah, their prayers are not answered because they do not believe in His power. If they pray to idols, they can't even hear them, let alone grant their request."

While the disbelievers only submit and obey when in a state of emergency or urgency, as in the word of Allah: And if you are overwritten by danger at sea, everything that (usual) you call for will disappear, except Him. (al-Isra\/17: 67) So when they boarded the ship, they prayed to Allah with full devotion (sincere) to Him, but when Allah saved them to land, they (returned) partnered with (Allah). (al-Ankabut\/29: 65) Allah explains that it is not only their bodies that submit, prostrate and obey Allah, but their shadows also prostrate in the morning and evening. Every object that is exposed to sunlight, especially in the morning and evening, of course, its shadows shorten or lengthen. All objects and their shadows are subject to Allah, either of their own free will or forced. This shows the power of the Most Perfect God."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the Prophet was asked by Allah SWT to ask those who associate partners with Allah, \"Who is the creator of the universe whose beauty is so amazing to humans?\" Then the Prophet himself was asked to answer the question and told them, \"It is Allah who created everything, arranges and maintains it in an orderly and perfect manner.\" Allah swt ordered the Prophet Muhammad saw to answer that question because the sound of the answer would be the same as that spoken by the polytheists themselves. They will not deny that the creator is Allah himself, as stated in His word: And if you ask them, \"Who created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?\" Surely they will answer, \"Allah.\" Then why can they be turned away (from the truth). (al-Ankabut\/29: 61) If indeed Allah is the creator of the universe, then should they take protectors other than Allah, even though the idols they worship cannot benefit or prevent harm. Why do they keep making inanimate objects become protectors? Why is their mind not used to make the right choice? Even though these objects do not have any ability even though they only create a fly. Allah's Word: Verily, whatever you call besides Allah cannot create even a single fly, even though they unite to create it. And if the fly takes something from them, they can't get it back from the fly. (al-hajj\/22: 73) Then in order to open the veil of their shortsightedness, so that they cannot compare between good and bad, the Prophet was ordered to tell them whether there are blind people who cannot see at all with people whose eyes healthy, can see all objects in front of him clearly and clearly? Of course the answer is not the same. If you also ask them, is it as dark as it is bright? Of course the answer is also not the same. Thus, it can finally be concluded that Allah, the One and Perfect in all things, cannot be equated with an idol, an inanimate object that absolutely cannot benefit and reject harm. Likewise, a person's disbelief in Allah and His Messenger is not the same as the light of a believer's faith that shines from his face and heart. The next question is whether the idols they worship can create creatures like God's creation, so that the two creations are similar in their eyes, and it is difficult to distinguish which is created by idols and which is created by God? If Allah can be equated with idols in creation then there is reason for them to associate partners with Him. However, this is not the case. These idols are inanimate objects, let alone their creation being equated with God's creation, they only exist because they were carved by human hands. They cannot answer when asked and cannot provide the slightest benefit or harm to their devotees. If the flies steal the offerings that are laid before them, they are absolutely unable to retrieve them. Even if the devotees are off guard, a wolf can piss on his head. Allah is the Creator of all things, including the Creator of idols, and He is the Almighty, Almighty God. Why do you worship other than Him, who does not benefit or harm at all?"

			"tafsir": "Allah sends down rainwater from the sky that contains clouds, then flows the rainwater into various wide and narrow valleys according to their size. Scientific studies explain that valleys are generally formed by scouring water. Water first erodes the softest parts of the rock and then forms streams. The flow of this river gradually enlarges to form river valleys. In addition to being influenced by the amount of water flow, the size of river valleys is also determined by the amount of rainfall, rock hardness and rock age. In the field of geomorphology, the river density is known, namely the number of river lengths contained in one area with units of km\/km2. The density of the river generally describes the amount of rainfall in the area. The water current will cause a lot of foam on the surface which is a lump of foam that moves along with the water current, so that when a strong wind blows, the foam will immediately disappear from sight. According to scientific studies, foam is a substance floating on water that contains a lot of air. The occurrence of foam is part of the water purification process that occurs naturally in its flow (known as self purification). This purification occurs due to mixing with air which dissolves into water, especially oxygen. In the presence of oxidation, impurities (usually organic compounds) dissolved in the water break down and the light parts float on the surface of the water, while the heavy parts sink and precipitate. This is the first parable put forward by Allah SWT about truth and falsehood and about faith and disbelief. Foam may also form in the metal refining process by heating. Metal ores in nature are generally found in impure solid materials. In the smelting process, the ore melts, and the heavy metals will sink while the part that is less useful or which can damage the quality of the product is usually in the form of foam and will float to the surface with the air contained therein. The metal is used for jewelery and household, agricultural, carpentry and industrial purposes. This is the second parable. Thus Allah makes a parable for the right and the wrong. When truth and falsehood are mixed, it is like a stream of water mixed with foam, or like metal being burned which both emit foam in the form of rust dirt which was originally attached to the metal, then separates due to the influence of the burning fire. So just as the foam that is above the flow of water will disappear when the wind blows, and the foam that is on the metal that is being burned will also disappear because of the fire, so also false things will disappear when clear rights and truth come. The foam will disappear stuck on the edge of the valley and trees or blown by the wind. Likewise, dirt or rust that was originally attached to the metal will burn out. What remains is only that which benefits humans, namely water, which can be drunk, used to irrigate plants that are beneficial to humans and animals, gold used for jewelry, and other metals for household appliances, agriculture, and so on. From the two parables, it can be understood that Allah swt has sent down the Al-Quran to the Prophet Muhammad and then conveyed it to the human heart, each of which has different potential and preparation to receive it. Each has limitations in terms of reading, understanding, memorization, and practice. Al-Quran verses become an element of spiritual life and happiness of life just as water is the cause of life for all beings. Some of the land that is hit by rain is barren, unable to grow plants, only storing water, which can be used as a source of clear water storage. There is also fertile land which after being watered with rain water can produce various crops. That is water that is beneficial to humans and animals. Among the metals that are smelted in fire, such as gold, silver, copper, bronze, and tin, some are used for household tools, carpentry, industry and so on. The believer is likened to water and metal which are beneficial to humans and animals. The foam that was originally mixed and then vanished because of the wind blowing or was completely burnt by the fire, is a parable for disbelief and falsehood which eventually disintegrates when faced with right and truth, says Allah: And say, \"The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished.\" Truly, the vanity must have disappeared. (al-Isra\/17: 81) Thus Allah makes a beautiful parable that can explain to people what is still difficult for them regarding the matters of their religion, so that the difference between what is right and what is wrong, between faith and disbelief is clear, so that they can take the path that leads to happiness and avoid the path that Allah displeases and leads astray. By paying attention to these correct and good parables, Muslims will undoubtedly be the best people brought out on earth to be role models for other people. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated a hadith from Abu Musa Al-Asyari: Indeed, the parable of guidance and knowledge that Allah sent me is like rainwater falling on the earth. Among them is a portion of the earth that receives the water, then grows grass and plants. There is also land that is barren, only stores water, then Allah gives the benefits of that water to humans. So some drink it and use it to water their gardens and fields. There is also some hard soil, unable to store and absorb water, so that nothing grows. That is the parable of a person who understands Allah's religion and Allah benefits him in the teachings of the religion that Allah sent me to convey to humans, so that he knows and teaches it (to others), and the parable of a person who completely does not pay attention and does not accept the instructions of Allah who sent me to deliver it. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Narrated also by Imam Ahmad from Abu Hurairah: My parable with you is like a person lighting a fire, when the fire illuminates the surrounding area, butterflies and insects that come to them fall into the fire, and that person blocks them, but is defeated. by the insects then enter the insects into the fire. That's my parable with you. I blocked you from the fire, stay away from the fire, but you defeated me and broke into it. (History of Ahmad, al-Bukhari, and Muslim from Abu Hurairah)"

If he is threatened with danger, then all of his wealth will be used as a hostage or ransom, for the sake of his safety. 2.

			"tafsir": "Allah swt characterizes ulul albab among believers, namely people who believe that what was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad is a valid truth, as follows: a. The first trait: that these people always fulfill God's promises, and do not want to break the agreement. What is meant by \"God's promises\" here are the promises they have made to themselves, both regarding their relationship with God, as well as their relationship with other people. Their pure nature, and their pure hearts acknowledge the existence of this agreement and Allah's revelation also requires the existence of this agreement. They do not want to deny or deny the agreement they have confirmed, because they are very far away from hypocrisy. How important is the nature of fulfilling this promise, Qatadah has mentioned that in the Al-Quran, Allah SWT has mentioned it more than twenty times. b. The second characteristic: they keep all of Allah's commandments and do not violate them, both the rights of Allah and the rights of His servants, including maintaining friendship. The relationship between fellow human beings is to establish a relationship of mutual help, establish love and affection, as mentioned in the hadith: From Abi Hurairah ra that he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah say, \"Whoever likes to expand his sustenance and always mentions his kindness , then you should maintain friendly relations.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim). And the hadith of the Prophet PBUH: From Ibn Abbas he said, \"Said the Messenger of Allah, \"Indeed virtue and linking friendship, both of them really relieve bad reckoning on the Day of Resurrection.\" Then Rasulullah saw read this verse.\" (History of al-Khatib and Ibn Asakir) c. The third characteristic: they really fear Allah swt. The nature of fear of Allah is a feeling of fear based on respect that encourages people to obey This characteristic is owned by the scholars, and is a characteristic of the \"muqarrabin\". In this connection Allah swt has said: Among the servants of Allah who fear Him, only the scholars. (Fathir\/35: 28) d. The fourth characteristic: they are always afraid of the reckoning that will harm them on the Day of Judgment, namely the bad results of their deeds on the Day of Judgment, because of the many crimes they committed while living in this world. Therefore, they are always self-aware, before their deeds will be accounted for in the hereafter. They always compare their good deeds with the bad, always try to make the good deeds outweigh the bad deeds, so that the balance of their virtues in the hereafter will be heavier than the bad balance. In this regard, Allah has said: So as for those whose scales (goodness) are heavy, then he is in a satisfying (happy) life. And as for those whose scales (goodness) are light, their place of return will be the Hawiyah hell. (al-Qariah\/101: 6 - 9) e. The fifth trait: they are always patient in facing all trials and obstacles, for the sake of expecting the pleasure of Allah. Patience in this case means refraining from anything that is not liked, either by obeying and fulfilling all the obligations that have been set by religion or by staying away from things that are prohibited by religion. It can also mean being willing to accept all of God's provisions that have been in effect in the form of calamities and so on. The patience that is asked of every person who has reason and faith is patience that is exercised solely for the sake of expecting Allah's pleasure and His reward, not patience that is made up because you want to be praised and mentioned. That is true patience, which characterizes people of understanding and faith. f. The sixth characteristic: they always establish prayer. The meaning of \"establishing prayers\" is to perform them in the best way possible, by perfecting the pillars and conditions, accompanied by a sense of solemnity and humility, turning your face and heart towards Allah alone, not accompanied by rejoicing, and observing the time allotted for it. This can only be done if during the times of prayer, we feel we are standing alone before Allah, the Creator and Ruler of the universe. Thus, there was nothing to think about at that time, except solely praying to Allah. g. Seventh characteristic: they always donate part of the sustenance that Allah has bestowed upon them, both secretly and openly, both obligatory donations such as for wives, children and close relatives and sunnah donations such as for the poor. Reality can give us an understanding of the secrets stored in it. The Al-Quran repeatedly advises believers to give part of their fortune to those who need help, and to support the public interest. If they want to do this, surely poverty and destitution can be eliminated from people's lives. h. The eighth characteristic: they always repel evil with good, because goodness can repel evil. The fact shows that if a person can get along with other people in a friendly and affectionate manner and help people who need help, he will not be despised or hated by society. If he encounters a disaster, then the person who has received his help will immediately extend help to him. On the other hand, people who like to hurt other people, or are reluctant to provide help and assistance, are selfish and do not use their minds. His attitude and actions only narrow the scope of his own life, and cause other people's hatred and envy towards him. Doing good to avoid evil, or as much as possible repaying other people's evil deeds by doing good or by being silent is a sign of someone who wants to use his mind and is wise. Allah's Word: \"... and when stupid people greet them (with insulting words), they say, \"salam.\" (al-Furqan \/ 25: 63) From this it can be understood, how high the value of religious teachings Islam in fostering good relations between human beings in order to create harmony and social welfare.At the end of this verse, Allah swt confirms that people who have these qualities will surely get a good final residence, namely Jannatun Naim heaven in the hereafter in the future. beside happiness, serenity, and well-being in this world."

Doing good to avoid evil, or as much as possible repaying other people's evil deeds by doing good or by being silent is a sign of someone who wants to use his mind and is wise. Allah's Word: \"... and when stupid people greet them (with insulting words), they say, \"salam.\" (al-Furqan \/ 25: 63) From this it can be understood, how high the value of religious teachings Islam in fostering good relations between human beings in order to create harmony and social welfare.At the end of this verse, Allah swt confirms that people who have these qualities will surely get a good final residence, namely Jannatun Naim heaven in the hereafter in the future. beside happiness, serenity, and well-being in this world."

			"tafsir": "There are several agreements between Allah and humans, among which are that humans are obliged to acknowledge the oneness of Allah and His nature and iradat, believe in His prophets and the revelations He sent down, and so on. Allah swt has provided clear evidence and arguments for all of that. However, in reality there are humans who have damaged the agreement, in the sense of: a. They don't pay attention to these promises, so they can't carry out the obligations that are the result of that agreement. For example, if they really stick to monotheism, they will certainly not worship anyone other than Allah. Allah gives clear proofs about His omnipotence. However, they did not pay attention so they continued to oppose the foundation of monotheism. They always adhere to shirk beliefs, trust and worship other than Allah. b. At first they paid attention to the promises they had made and the arguments that had been given. They have acknowledged and believed in its truth, but then they have denied the truth, and are no longer willing to practice it. People who like to deny and violate promises that have been made are called \"hypocrites\". In this connection, the Messenger of Allah has said: Abi Hurairah ra narrated that the Prophet saw said, \"The signs of a hypocrite are of three kinds: when he speaks, he always lies, when he promises he always breaks them, and when he is trusted to betray.\" (Muslim history, at-Tirmidhi and an-Nasai) In interpreting this verse 25, Abu al-Aliyah, a mufasir, states that there are six kinds of characteristics of hypocrites that they show if they feel they have a strong position in one society, namely: 1. When they speak, they lie. 2. If they promise, they break it. 3. When given trust, they betray. 4. They like to deny God's promises that they have previously made. 5. Likes to break friendships that Allah commands to be connected and maintained like relationships with His Prophets who have come to bring the truth. They only believe in some of the prophets, and disbelieve in some others. They also cut ties between humans, especially with believers, but they still maintain relations and provide assistance to unbelievers. Among their examples is that they hinder every effort that leads to cultivating a harmonious and compassionate life. They do not want to see the realization of unity and oneness between believers, as recommended by the Prophet: A believer to another believer must be like a building, one part strengthens the other part. (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and at-Tirmidhi from Abu Musa al-Asyari) And the Word of the Prophet PBUH: The believers are like one body, when one of its members suffers from illness, the other members are also willing suffers from not sleeping and feels feverish because of it. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim history from an-Numan bin Basyir) Therefore, Muslims must be careful in maintaining the unity and unity between them, do not enter into incitement and attempts by the hypocrites to break up that unity. c. They like to do damage to the earth, both in the form of injustice that they commit against themselves and injustice that they commit against other people's property in an illegitimate way, or by causing slander and calamity in Muslim society, and inflaming hostility and war against them. At the end of this verse, Allah determines the appropriate punishment to be meted out to the hypocrites considering the evil of their behavior and deeds. The punishment is in the form of Allah's curse, which keeps them away from His mercy, so that they are eliminated from the goodness of this world and the hereafter. They will meet a very bad end, namely the punishment of Hell, as a reward for the crimes and sins they have committed."

They are people who are diligent and skilled in searching for wealth, and doing various kinds of business. In addition, they are thrifty and careful and good at managing and using their property. On the other hand, Allah also limits the sustenance for some of His servants, so that the sustenance they earn is no more than what is needed daily. They are usually lazy and unskilled people in finding treasure, or not good at managing and using the treasure. Allah expands and narrows the sustenance of His servants based on His wisdom and knowledge about each of them. These two things have nothing to do with the level of faith and disbelief of His servants. Therefore, there are times when Allah bestows a lot of sustenance on His disbelieving servants. On the other hand, sometimes Allah narrows the sustenance for believing servants to increase the reward they will receive in the hereafter. So wealth and poverty are two things that can happen to believers as well as unbelievers, pious or wicked. This verse further tells that the polytheists of Mecca who like to deny Allah's promises, are very happy with the many possessions they have, and the abundance of worldly life, and they think that these possessions are the greatest favors and luck. Therefore, at the end of this verse Allah points out their mistake, and emphasizes that the pleasures of this worldly life are only small pleasures, short in time, and easily and quickly lost, compared to the pleasures in the hereafter which are of great value and for all time. Thus, it is not appropriate if they are proud of the pleasures in the world that they feel. In this connection, the history conveyed by Imam at-Tirmidhi from Ibn Masud states as follows: Once the Messenger of Allah slept on a mat then he woke up from his sleep, and visible marks of the mat on his stomach, then we said, \"O Messenger of Allah if we take it bed for you?\" The Prophet said, \"What does this world mean to me. I live in this world just like a rider who takes shelter under a tree for a while, then he sets off again and leaves the tree.\" (Narrated at-Tirmidhi from Ibn Masud)"

Among them were Abu Sufyan bin Harb (before converting to Islam), Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah, and his friends. They once said, \"Why was Muhammad not sent down the evidence as has been revealed to the previous prophets and apostles, such as the fall of the sky in pieces upon them, turning the Mount of Safa into gold, or shifting the mountains from around the city of Mecca, so that the vacant places can be turned into gardens.\" Their other sayings are mentioned in the Al-Quran, among others contained in the following verse: Try to bring us a miracle like the messengers who have been sent. (al-Anbiya\/21: 5) With their utterances like that, it was as if all the real signs and evidence given to the Prophet Muhammad such as the Al-Quran and others, were not real proof of his apostleship that could encourage them to obedience and faith in Allah, or as a truth that cannot be doubted. Furthermore, Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to explain to the polytheists that the revelation of these evidences does not play a role in making someone get directions or become astray. Everything is in the power of Allah alone. Only Allah swt has the power to mislead those whom He wills, and guide those who like to repent to the path that pleases Him. Even though the Prophet Muhammad had miracles that proved his apostleship, that would not be of any use to make someone a believer. All one has to do to have faith is to be humble, obedient, and ask Allah for guidance, to gain good luck in this world and in the hereafter, and to avoid the deceptions and temptations of Satan. For people who believe, the Koran is a miracle that proves the apostleship of the Prophet Muhammad, so that no other evidence is needed. On the other hand, polytheists are immersed in misguidance and denial, so that any proofs or miracles shown by the Prophet will not make them believers."

But earlier, this verse explained that even though there is one reading or Scripture that can cause mountains to move, the earth to split open, or people who have died to come back to life and speak, there will still be people who do not believe. The meaning of the above statement is that Allah has given miracles to the Prophet Musa, such as Mount Tur can walk, and a rock can release springs after being hit with his staff. Allah swt has also given miracles to the Prophet Isa, so that he can revive those who have died. To the Prophet Muhammad, Allah has given the greatest miracle, namely the Koran, a miracle that is eternal and can still be seen today. The Qur'an contains evidence showing the greatness of Allah's power and the beauty of His creation. In addition, the Al-Quran contains wisdom, laws, and regulations that are needed by humans to regulate life in various fields, both economic, political, social, and so on, which guarantees a happy life in this world and the hereafter if they want. understand and practice it. Thus, they will appear to be the best nation and people on this earth. According to ath-Thabrani from Ibn Abbas that there was a group of Meccan polytheists, including Abu Jahal and Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah, who held a meeting behind the Kaaba, and sent someone to summon the Prophet Muhammad. He then came to their place, and Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah told him that they would be willing to become his followers if he could prove the miracle of the Koran to move the mountains around Mecca, so that the place became spacious and could be used as a agricultural land. If the Messenger of Allah could do this, then they would believe that he was truly a prophet and messenger. They also asked the Prophet to be able to master the wind and make it a vehicle to and from Mecca to the land of Sham. According to them, this would prove that Muhammad was truly a prophet and messenger of Allah like Prophet Sulaiman who was able to use the wind as a vehicle. Apart from that, they also asked Muhammad to revive his ancestors who had long died, such as Qushai bin Kilab or whoever they wanted among their dead ancestors. They would ask the person who was revived whether the message conveyed by Muhammad was true or not. According to them, this was to prove that the Prophet Muhammad was truly a prophet and messenger of Allah, as was the case with Prophet Isa who miraculously revived people who had died. Allah swt then sent down the verse above to emphasize that if Allah granted what they asked for it became part of the miracles of the Al-Quran, surely this could happen, because everything is under His power. However, if this is truly granted, they still will not believe in Allah, the Prophet Muhammad, and the Al-Quran which is his miracle. The Prophet Muhammad really wanted them to believe, but they did not believe either, and even put forward various requests. Therefore in this verse, Allah SWT gives comfort to him by emphasizing that he and the believers must really understand that if Allah wants all people to believe, Allah will surely guide them all. In addition, believers must also believe that disbelievers will always be afflicted with disaster and Allah's wrath because of their disbelief and bad deeds. The disaster could happen near their place of residence, so finally came what God promised, namely their own destruction. At the end of this verse, Allah confirms that Allah's promise to help the Muslims and destroy the disbelievers will definitely happen, because Allah will not break His promises."

Allah said, \"Is the Allah who watches over their actions the same as those who deify those who do not have such qualities?\" Because the polytheists made several partners for Allah swt, Allah ordered His messenger to say to them, \"Name the characteristics possessed by what you consider to be a rival or partner to Allah!\" All of them simply do not have the characteristics of perfection as possessed by Allah swt. Therefore, it is inappropriate to be His partner. Their remarks and demands to the Prophet Muhammad as mentioned above also give the impression that there is an assumption that Allah does not seem to know what is happening on this earth. Therefore, in this verse, Allah SWT asks them, do they say these words with the intention of informing Allah SWT about events that are happening on earth that they think Allah does not know? Yet God knows what happens in nature. Because the polytheists associate partners with Allah with others, in this verse Allah commands the Prophet Muhammad to ask them, do they mention Allah's \"associates\" just as an outward statement, and do not have the essence of truth at all? If that's the case, then their speech is nonsense that has no substance of truth at all. Yet Allah has no partners at all. He is Most High and Most Perfect. At the end of this verse, Allah swt opens the secret cover of the misguidance of disbelievers and polytheists, that is, they have been captivated by various temptations of Satan who have shown them that the deceit they are doing is a good and a commendable deed. Because they have complied with Satan's seduction, they have been hindered and diverted from the way of Allah.

In addition, the Al-Quran was revealed in Arabic, which is a language that has several features that other languages do not have. Among the features of the Arabic language is that it is a language that has developed long before the arrival of Islam so that its vocabulary is very rich. Arabic also has a word formation system (morphology) that allows it to easily accommodate new concepts for the formation of new words. Thus, it can be understood that the ability of the Arabic language to express the concepts of revelation. Because the Al-Quran is in Arabic, the Al-Quran has preserved Arabic so that it is not lost like Syriac, Coptic, and so on. Because the Koran was revealed in Arabic and became a miracle of the Prophet Muhammad as a holy book, translations of the Koran in foreign languages are not considered holy books either. As is well known, one of the honors possessed by the Al-Quran is that reading it is considered as worship, and may not be touched except by holy people, namely people who have no big or small limits. Many verses mention the characteristics of the Al-Quran, including the words of Allah SWT: (Which) will not be visited by evil, either from the front or from behind (in the past and in the future), which is sent down from God the Most Wise, Praised be. (Fushshilat\/41: 42) Furthermore, Allah SWT warned the Prophet Muhammad SAW and Muslims in general, so that they do not obey the desires and desires of those who deny the Al-Quran, either in part or in whole, because Allah SWT has given true knowledge to them. them, namely Al-Quran al-Karim.

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah swt explains that He has sent messengers before Prophet Muhammad saw and they were married and had children. This shows that family life and procreation is a natural thing and is a sunnatullah for His creatures who live on this earth. This sunatullah also applies to His prophets and messengers. Family life should not be seen as an obstacle in the struggle, whether for personal, societal or national progress. Even marriage according to Islamic teachings, apart from aiming to continue offspring, also functions to provide peace, tranquility, and stability in life. Marriage also strengthens friendship between the families concerned and can be a means of preaching Islamiyah, as was done by the Prophet Muhammad. Because family life is something that is natural and is sunatullah, then humans should not be against it. Therefore, it is wrong if there are religious leaders who think that they must stay away from family life, so as not to interfere with practicing religion. The attitude of celibacy or tabattul is something that is not known in Islam, and is even strongly opposed. Marriage and children are God's grace and mercy to His servants. Therefore, marriage and family need to be maintained and preserved as well as possible. In one history it is stated that the Jews criticized the Prophet Muhammad because he had several wives. They said that if Muhammad really was a prophet and messenger, of course he would only concern himself with his prophetic duties and would not care about women. They also asked for various proofs about his prophethood, apart from the Al-Quran which was his miracle. Allah swt has refuted them by asserting that the Prophet Muhammad was not the first apostle of Allah, but before that Allah swt had sent several messengers and all of them were ordinary people who needed to eat, drink, have a family and procreate, and do things that were done by other people. other people, walking in the market, and so on. In this case, Allah swt ordered the Prophet Muhammad to emphasize: Truly I am only a human being like you, who has received revelations. (al-Kahf\/18: 110) Then, in this verse it is emphasized about the reasonableness and permissibility of the apostles living in families and having children. Allah confirmed that He gave them wives and offspring. In a hadith narrated by Imam al-Bukhari and Imam Muslim from Anas bin Malik it is stated that the Prophet Muhammad said: As for me, I fast and break my fast, I pray at night, I also sleep, I also eat meat and also marry women; So whoever doesn't like my Sunnah (my way of life) is not one of my people. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) As for the prophetic and apostolic verses or proofs demanded by the disbelievers from the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran has repeatedly answered that this matter is the authority of Allah alone. The apostles only performed their miracles with Allah's permission. The greatest miracle of the Prophet Muhammad is the Al-Quran which carries teachings, laws and regulations that play a role in guiding humans to happiness in this world and the hereafter. The purity of the Al-Quran is always maintained and no creature can match it, both in terms of its content and its language editor. Verses or proofs and miracles do not just appear, but must be in accordance with Allah's wisdom and in harmony with the time. Each of these periods has its own characteristics that have been determined by God. Every event that occurs in nature follows His provisions or destiny, both regarding the time, place, method, and causes of occurrence. Miracles will not appear before God's appointed time. A person's death, sustenance, and events experienced in this world and in the hereafter occur according to Allah's provisions. Man cannot ask that his death come sooner or later than what Allah has ordained in His destiny."
