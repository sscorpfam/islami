Its truth values cannot be disputed or disputed by anyone, and its wisdom values cannot be doubted. The proofs of the truth that the Qur'an was sent down from Allah and contains correct instructions are also explained in other verses. Allah says: And indeed, this (Qur'an) was truly sent down by the Lord of the worlds, which was brought down by ar-Ruh al-Amin (Gabriel), into your heart (Muhammad) so that you may be among those who warn , in clear Arabic.

The meaning of \"bringing the truth\" in this verse is to bring orders to all human beings so that they worship only Allah Almighty. Then Allah explained that the correct way of worship is only to worship Allah alone, by purifying obedience to Him, free from the influence of shirk and joy. The truth contained in the Qur'an is in accordance with the truth contained in the books revealed to the previous messengers. Thus, all worship that is addressed to other than Allah or worship that is not directly addressed to Him is worship that is not true."

			"tafsir": "Allah then ordered His messenger to remind his people that the holy religion is Allah's religion. The meaning of religion in this verse is worship and obedience. Therefore, worship and obedience should be directed to Allah alone, clean from shirk and joy. Idol worshipers argue that God is a substance that is beyond the reach of human senses. Therefore, it is impossible for humans to directly worship Him. If people want to worship Him, according to them, they should use an intermediary who is entrusted with the task of conveying their worship to Allah. These intermediaries are angels and jinn, who sometimes assume human form. They are considered God. As for the carved statues that are placed in places of worship, these are statues that depict God, but are not the real God. It's just that in general ignorance causes them to no longer distinguish between statues and God so they worship the statue as they worship God, like the situation of people who worship animals. They no longer distinguish between worshiping animals and worshiping the Creator of animals. The Arabs of Jahiliyyah painted statues of various shapes, some depicting stars, angels, prophets and pious people who had passed away. They worshiped the statues as a symbol for each of these gods. Such was the opinion of the polytheists in the past and before Muhammad was sent as an apostle. Then came the Messenger of Allah with an order to destroy their idols and eradicate the wrong assumptions from their minds, and replace them with teachings that lead the mind to believe in monotheism. Allah said: And indeed, We have sent a messenger for every nation (to call), \"Worship Allah, and stay away from thagut.\" (an-Nahl\/16: 36) And His words: And We did not send any messenger before you (Muhammad), but We revealed to him, that there is no god (who has the right to be worshiped) besides Me, so worship Me. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 25) As a broader explanation of the Quraysh's acknowledgment of the existence of God, Qatadah said that when the polytheists of Mecca were asked who their God was, who created them, and who created the sky and the earth and sends down rain from the sky, they say, \"Allah.\" Then when asked of them, why they worship idols, they also replied, \"So that these idols draw them closer to Allah as close as possible and the idols give intercession when they need help from Allah.\" Then regarding the attitude of the polytheists who are similar to that Allah says: So why (idols and gods) that they worship besides Allah to draw closer (to Him) cannot help them? Even the gods had disappeared from them? (al-A.hqaf\/46: 28) Allah threatens their attitudes and actions and shows them the consequences they will feel. Allah will decide what they disputed on the day of reckoning. On that day, the truth of the monotheistic religion will no longer be covered up and the evil of idol worship will be seen clearly. Each adherent will get the appropriate reward. Those who stick to the religion of monotheism will find a place full of enjoyment. While those who always wallow in the valley of polytheism will find a place to return full of suffering. At the end of this verse, Allah emphasizes that He will not give guidance to people who deny the truth and deny the religion of monotheism because of their irreparable error. They used various ways to associate Allah with other gods, such as worshiping idols, or assuming that Allah had children and so on. All of that is nothing but their assumptions that are far from the truth and drag them into the valley of error."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains in more detail the actions that caused them to fall astray. God pointed out that had He wished to have children, He would not have taken children as they say. Of course God has the power to choose children according to His will, and those chosen are of course sons. However, why did those Meccan infidels say that Allah had daughters, even though they themselves were reluctant to have daughters? Allah said: Or (is it appropriate) for Him daughters while for you sons? (ath-thur\/52: 39) And His word: Is (appropriate) for you male and for Him female? That is certainly an unfair distribution. (an-Najm\/53: 21-22) The notion that God has children regardless of their form, is including associating partners with God with other gods. This means dividing the power of God. After all, the child must inherit power from the father, and when that power is divided, the omnipotence of Allah is lost. This cannot happen because Allah, who created the heavens and the earth and their contents, certainly has unlimited power, so that His power cannot be divided. That is why Allah emphasized that He is Most Holy from the qualities expressed by the polytheists. On the other hand, Allah emphasizes that He is One and Only, childless and fatherless. He does not need anything, in fact He is All-Conquering. He has power to subdue whatever is in the heavens and on earth and all that is in it, and forces them to submit under His dominion and obey according to His will."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains that He created the heavens and the earth with the right purpose. He decorated the sky with the sun and moon. Each has trajectories according to the provisions that have been determined by Allah. Because of the rotation of the earth on its axis, it is as if the sun is seen moving in the sky from east to west, so there is a change of day and night. When the sun appears on the eastern horizon it is day and when the sun sets on the western horizon it is night. This is what happens every day. The events that occurred were solely due to Allah's will, which He had determined when He created the universe. Allah closes the night over the day is an expression of the parable where the day which is marked by the bright sunlight is likened to an open place, while the night which is marked by the closing of the sun is likened to a curtain covering an open place. So when it is said that the night covers the day, the meaning is that the bright sunlight is covered by the dark curtain of the night. Allah closing the day over the night is the opposite of the parable mentioned otherwise. The day is likened to a bright light and the night is likened to places that are pitch black. At noon, the sun's bright light covers the darkness of the night, until the darkness of the night changes to light. This kind of view is an everyday view according to the observations of ordinary people. However, if one were to think more carefully, one would be able to understand that the length of day and night is not the same. For places around the equator, the length and shortness of day and night are always around the same, around 12 hours. However, for places that are north of the equator, when the sun is moving in the north, the noon time for these areas is longer. The increase in daylight hours is directly proportional to the position of the place on earth and the position of the sun. So that in several places in the northern arctic region when the sun is in the northernmost hemisphere, these areas will experience continuous daylight. It can be said, the farther a place is from the equator and the farther the position of the sun is from the celestial equator, the longer the daytime so that in certain areas it lasts continuously. So from the closest place to the farthest from the equator there is a part of the night that is covered by the day which gets longer. Until one day the day completely covered the night. Means that noon spends the entire circle of the sun's circulation. In other words the day completely covers the night. After that, Allah explained that he had subdued the sun and the moon. Means that the circulation of the sun and the moon is in accordance with the provisions that have been arranged by Allah at the time of creation. If what is meant by the apparent daily circulation of the sun, then from the time the sun culminates to the next culmination it takes approximately 24 hours. But if what is meant by the annual circulation, namely the apparent circulation of the sun among the stars, it takes one year. As for the circulation of the month from ijtima' to the next ijtima, it takes as much as one month. Terms of time as much as one month according to calendar calculations based on the circulation of the month. The provisions on the circulation time are provisions in outline only. To get more precise figures, requires a more thorough and in-depth discussion. But what can be understood is that the sun and moon circulate according to a certain circulation time; one might even say that it circulates according to conditions that are almost certain. That is why Allah emphasized that each celestial body circulates according to the time determined according to its respective circulation. Therefore, when the time comes for the sun and moon to lose their balance, they deviate more and more from their normal circulation. Something similar will happen on the Day of Resurrection, which is the day when the heavens and the earth and everything in them will fall apart. Allah said: (Remember) on the day of heaven We roll it up like sheets of paper. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 104) At the end of the verse, Allah orders His servants to seek forgiveness from Him by rushing to worship and purify obedience to Him. Allah also reminds them that He is Mighty and His provisions cannot be disputed. Allah is Forgiving to His servants who are aware and like to be guided to the right path."

			"tafsir": "Allah shows the signs of His power in the creation of human beings. God explains that He created man in the beginning alone. God created humans of various colors and languages from Adam. Then Allah created his partner Eve. Allah also explained that He also created eight pairs of livestock. A pair of goats, a pair of sheep, a pair of camels and a pair of cows. God explains further about human events. Humans are created through a process of event after event. The process of its first occurrence is as a germ, after which it goes through process after process as condensed blood then becomes a fetus. It is at the perfect time to become a fetus that God creates a spirit in it so that it becomes a living being. Signs of life can be known from the heartbeat by placing the ear to the mother's stomach. Regarding the process of human occurrence in the mother's stomach, the Prophet Muhammad said: In fact, the incident of someone among you in the mother's stomach is the first 40 days in the form of semen (sperm), then becomes 'alaqah (something that hangs) at a time like that again (40 days) , then becomes a \"Mudhgah\" (a lump of flesh) in such a period (40 days. Then an angel is sent (by Allah), then he blows the spirit into the fetus, and Allah orders to determine 4 things: his sustenance, his age, his deeds, whether he people who are wretched or happy. (Muslim history from Ibn Mas'ud) In addition, Allah explains that when a baby is in the womb, he is in three darknesses, namely on the inside of the membrane that covers the baby in the womb so that the baby is protected from the influence decay. To the eye, at first glance the membrane seems to be just one layer, but when examined closely, the membrane has three layers. Scientists explain that three layers make The things that can protect the fetus while in the womb are: 1. The amniotic membrane, which contains fluid so that the fetus is swimming. This condition protects the fetus if there is a collision from the outside. In addition, this swimming position provides an opportunity for the fetus to position itself when it is about to be born. 2. The chorion membrane layer 3. The decidual membrane layer Some researchers attribute the three layers of darkness in the ayat above to the layers of the amniotic membrane that surround the uterus, the wall of the uterus itself, and the abdominal wall in the abdomen. God emphasized that the one who did this was God the Creator of human beings and who rules over the heavens and the earth and their contents. Therefore, He has the right to be worshiped. There is no God worthy of worship except He, the One and only God who has no partners. At the end of the verse, Allah asks the polytheists a question that contains ridicule towards them, why can they be turned away from worshiping only Allah, becoming worshipers of statues, even though they already have the ability to read the signs of the oneness and power of Allah in nature. universe and exist in themselves."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains that if the polytheists continue to deny His omnipotence, even though there is sufficient evidence for this, then this will not harm Allah in the slightest. He does not need anything from all of His creatures. Allah said: And Musa said, \"If you and those who are on earth all deny (the favors of Allah), then surely Allah is Rich, Most Praised.\" (Ibrahim\/14: 8) In the Qudsi hadith it is explained: \"O My servants, if the former and the last of you, humans and jinn all gathered in the heart of the most evil person, then such an attitude does not reduce my power in the slightest.\" (Muslim history from Abu dzarr al-Gifari) Allah explains that He does not give up disbelief for His servants. Denial is fundamentally against the human spirit. The human soul and all of Allah's creatures are created according to the nature of their occurrence, which should be subject to the provisions of their Creator. However, if they are grateful for Allah's blessings, surely He will like it, because such a situation is in accordance with the nature of its occurrence, and in accordance with the sunatullah. Allah said: Indeed, if you are grateful, I will surely increase (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then surely My punishment will be very heavy. (Ibrahim\/14: 7) Then Allah explained that everyone, on the Day of Resurrection, will be required to account for their deeds while living in the world. Everyone who sins is responsible for his sinful actions. He will not bear the sins of others. After that, each person will be brought before his Lord to receive an explanation about his deeds during his life in the world. Not a single good or bad deed remains. At that time the deeds of each person will be rewarded accordingly. If the record of his deeds is full of good deeds, surely he will get a place full of pleasures. But if the records of his deeds are full of bad deeds, surely he will get a place full of suffering. As Allah says: And that man only gets what he has worked for, and indeed his efforts will be shown (to him), then he will be rewarded with the most perfect reward. (an-Najm\/53: 39-41) It should be remembered that someone who commits evil, then someone else follows him, then he will receive additional sins from the evil committed by those who imitate him. In this regard, the Messenger of Allah once stated the following: Whoever makes good habits in Islam, he will receive a reward plus the reward of the person who does it until the Day of Judgment without reducing that person's reward in the least. And whoever does bad habits in Islam, he will get his sin, plus the sins of those who do it until the Day of Judgment, without reducing that person's sins in the slightest. (Muslim history and an-Nasa'i from Abu dzarr) At the end of this verse Allah explains, that He is All-Knowing of what is stored in the breasts of His servants. Thus there can be no deed that escapes the actions of God, both actions that can be witnessed by other people or actions that are only known by the doer himself."

However, when he gets a blessing where his illness and suffering have disappeared, he forgets the words he made when he prayed. Then they fabricated other gods as partners for Allah. They not only mislead themselves, but also mislead other people, hindering people who declare themselves as people who believe in monotheism. At the end of the verse, Allah commands His messengers to say to people who deny Allah's favors, \"Be satisfied with carrying out your desires while living in this world, enjoy the delights that don't last long, until death takes your soul.

The same command was given by Allah to His Messenger to ask them whether those who know are the same as those who do not know. What is meant by people who know are people who know the rewards they will receive, because of their good deeds, and the punishment they will receive if they commit immorality. Meanwhile, those who do not know are those who do not know about it at all, because they do not have the slightest hope of getting a reward for their good deeds, and do not expect to be punished for their bad deeds.

Allah also ordered the Muslims to prepare themselves to migrate to Medina, and ordered them to be steadfast because they were separated from their homeland, relatives and friends. The order was given with an explanation that if the freedom of the Muslims in carrying out Allah's orders in Mecca is disturbed, then they should emigrate to another country where it is possible to provide peace in carrying out Allah's commands. This command is illustrated in God's brief word \"And God's earth is wide.\" Allah said: \"Isn't Allah's earth wide, so that you can emigrate (move) in that earth?\" (an-Nisa'\/4: 97) At the end of the verse, Allah explains that only those who are patient will receive unlimited rewards, as experienced by the people who were earlier than them."

If one looks at it as if the event were a cycle that started at a point in a circle, starting from something, then it grew bigger, then it got old, then it died or died, then a new incident started again and so on up to a period determined by God, namely the end of this natural event. According to scientific studies, the distribution and dynamics of water in the soil is described in this verse. Apart from being running water that flows directly on the surface of the ground, some of the water that falls from the sky either as rainwater or melted snow will infiltrate (infiltrate) into the soil and spread in the soil pores. Water will be retained by the soil pores with a force that is inversely proportional to the size of the soil pores. In soil pores with a large size, water will be pulled by gravity and can flow (percolate) to lower layers of soil or rock or flow laterally in the direction of the slope. Shallow groundwater that flows in the direction of the slope will come out again as springs. Water flowing down to the lower layers will then fill the groundwater-carrying layer (aquifer), which is a layer of soil or rock composed of coarse grains, mainly sand. If this aquifer emerges to the surface of the ground, for example at a slope bend, springs will also be found at the location where it appears. Pores with a smaller size, known as capillary pores, will hold water in it as soil moisture. The water contained in these capillary pores will not be released except by a greater stress than gravity, generally by evaporation, or in the deeper layers by the suction power of plant roots. This soil moisture is then used by plants for metabolism and then evaporates from the stomata of leaves and other plant parts that contain chlorophyll. Evaporation of groundwater in this way is known as transpiration. Soil that has enough moisture will be characterized by the plants that cover it have green leaves. If the humidity is reduced, the leaves will gradually turn yellow and then dry out. The dried leaves will fall off to reduce the evaporation process. Water evaporated by the sun's heat, then becomes a lumpy cloud, driven back by the wind to a place so that it rains. The process of such events becomes material for reflection for people who want to use their minds. Of course there is a Almighty Substance that arranges all of that, so that everything happens in an orderly and neat manner. There's no way a human could do that. The one who does all of that is certainly the One who has the right to be worshiped and obeyed by all His commands."

It is because of their ignorance and narrow-mindedness that their hearts remain closed, and do not allow the rays of Divine light to enter into their hearts. The two kinds of people are certainly not the same. In another verse, Allah confirms the dissimilarity of the two kinds of people. Allah said: And is the person who has died and then We brought him back to life and We gave him a light so that he can walk in the midst of the crowd, the same as someone who is in darkness, so that he cannot get out of there? (al-An'am\/6: 122) Ibn 'Abbas narrated, \"Among the people whose breasts Allah has widened to accept the religion of Islam, is Abu Bakr ra Ibn Mardawaih narrated from Ibn Mas'ud he said: The Messenger of Allah read this verse, then we asked, \"O Prophet of Allah, how is that open heart?\" He replied, \"When light illuminates the heart, it becomes open and spacious.\" We asked, \"What is such a sign, O Messenger of Allah?\" He replied, \"Facing yourself with the eternal life of the country and distancing yourself from the life of a country that is full of deceit and preparing yourself to die before death comes.\" (History of Ibn Mardawaih) Narrated by at-Tirmidhi from Ibn 'Umar, he said: That someone said, \"O Messenger of Allah, which believer is the best?\" Rasulullah SAW replied, \"Those who remember death a lot and prepare for death the most, and when light shines on their hearts, the heart opens and becomes spacious.\" Companions asked, \"What is the sign like that, O Prophet of Allah?\" The Prophet replied, \"Facing the land that is eternal and keeping away from the land that is full of deceit and preparing to die before death comes.\" As for those who rough and petrified hearts will have a big accident because of their stubborn attitude do not want to remember Him. Their hearts should soften when God's name is called before them, but their faces turn black and somber when they hear God's name called and their hearts turn hard and hard. Narrated by at-Tirmidhi from Ibn 'Umar, he said: The Messenger of Allah said: Do not talk too much without mentioning the name of Allah, because talking too much without mentioning the name of Allah causes the heart to harden. And verily the person who is farthest from Allah is the one whose heart is hard.\" At the end of this verse it is explained that the person whose heart is hard is the person whose eyes are blind, they are truly in a real error. Everyone easily knows their badness That."

One slave is owned by several masters, they are united in their ownership. While other slaves are only owned by a master, no one else owns them. At one time the first slave received orders from his masters with different orders, such as the first master ordered to clean his yard, the second master ordered to hoe his garden, the third master ordered to clean his house and so on. This command is given at the same time. Which command of the master must be carried out by the slave? It is impossible for the slave to carry out every order from his master at the same time. And so on so that the slave is always confused in obeying the orders of each master. As for the second slave who only had a master, he could carry out his master's orders well, he would not be confused in carrying out the order, and his master was relieved because his slave could carry out his orders well. Is the condition of the two slaves the same and is the condition of the master of each slave the same? This is the case with people who believe in monotheism and people who believe in shirk. People who believe in monotheism are never confused in carrying out orders and prohibitions from their Lord, because these orders and prohibitions originate from the One and Only God. A shirk religion is always in a state of confusion, which command of his god will he follow. Conversely, people who believe in monotheism only worship the One God, while people who believe in shirk are always confused, which god is more worthy of worship than other gods. After explaining the heresy of shirk, Allah emphasized that all praise is only for Him, not for others. Only He has the right to be worshiped, but most people don't want to know about it."

That is, He is the one who holds the human spirit when it comes to death by severing the connection between the spirit and the body and holding the person's spirit at birth so that it cannot control its body, but the relationship between them still exists. God retains the soul of the person He has ordained death by not returning the spirit, and releases another soul by returning the soul to its body, so that it can wake up from its sleep until the appointed time. A person who dies is held by God's spirit so that he cannot return to his body and a person who has not died just sleeps, his spirit is released so that he can return to his body again. It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that in the human body there is a soul and a spirit whose relationship is like sunlight. The mind and soul can think and make choices, while the spirit causes it to live and move. Both of them were turned off when he died, and his soul was turned off only when he slept, while his spirit was still there. Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated a hadith from Abu Hurairah which reads: The Messenger of Allah said, \"If one of you is going to sleep, then let him blow into his clothes on the inside, because he does not know what is left in it, then let him say, \"O my Lord with your name I lay my stomach, and with your name also I lift it.

Indeed, in that incident there are signs of Allah's power for the believers. They know that everything is arranged by God. There is nothing in this life that is outside of His rule"

Many people think that because their sins have piled up, God will no longer forgive them. Be he who despairs of His forgiveness, mercy, and compassion. The world has become dark in his eyes because so far he has not heeded the teachings of his religion and has always turned his back on the instructions contained therein. His heart was full of filth and lawlessness, and he could no longer see the path of truth and goodness that he would follow. He has been confused by a sense of hopelessness and there is no hope that seems to him to return from the misguidance and disobedience that he has always done. But Allah, even though the sins of His servants are great, He still loves and supports them and forbids them to despair of His mercy and compassion, He still views them as His servants who are entitled to receive His love when they realize their mistakes and ask for forgiveness. to her. Let alone those who believe, even for polytheists the door of repentance is still open if they convert to Islam and believe in Allah and His Messenger. It was narrated by Imam al-Bukhari from Sa'id bin Jubair from Ibn 'Abbas that many polytheists who had committed murders and often committed adultery came to the Prophet Muhammad. They said to him, \"Indeed what you call on us is good. Can you explain to us that what we did before that He will forgive.\" The Prophet replied by reciting the word of Allah: And those who do not associate partners with Allah with other gods and do not kill those whom Allah has made unlawful except for the right (reasons), and do not commit adultery; and whoever does this, surely he will receive a severe punishment, (namely) the punishment will be multiplied for him on the Day of Judgment and he will remain in that punishment, in humiliation, except for those who repent and believe and do good; then God replaced their evil with good. Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful. (al-Furqan\/25: 68-70) In the hadith of the Prophet saw it is also explained: It was narrated from 'Amr bin 'Anbasah that an old man who had come to meet the Prophet had come to lean on his cane and said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah, I do a lot of mistakes and immorality. Is it possible that mistakes can be forgiven?\" The Prophet replied, \"Have you acknowledged that there is no god but Allah?\" The old man replied, \"Yes, even I admit that you are the messenger of God.\" Rasulullah saw emphasized, Allah forgives all the mistakes and immorality that you have done.\" will not return to making mistakes, and will continue to do good deeds. Servants of Allah must not despair of His forgiveness, mercy, and compassion, because the door of His grace is wide open for those who repent, as confirmed in His word : And whoever commits evil and wrongs himself, then he asks Allah's forgiveness, surely he will get Allah, Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.(an-Nisa'\/4: 110) After forbidding His servants to despair of mercy and compassion Allah, Allah encourages His servants to immediately ask forgiveness and repent to Him for all the mistakes and mistakes that have been committed. a forgives all sins except the sin of shirk as mentioned in His word: Indeed, Allah will not forgive (sins) for associating partners with Him (shirk), and He forgives what (sins) are other than (shirk) for whom He wills. Whoever associates partners with Allah, then indeed, he has committed a great sin. (an-Nisa'\/4: 48) Indeed, God's mercy is great and wide for His servants. Servants who have disobeyed because they ignored His commands, violated the laws that He has established, and wallowed in sin and immorality, are still being called as His servants and advised not to despair of His forgiveness and mercy."

Nothing can save them, as if they are surrounded by danger and calamity from all directions. Wherever they ran they were always confronted by things that were so frightening that at that time no human thought except for his own safety from the dangers of death. This is explained in the word of God: On that day man will flee from his brother, and from his mother and father, and from his wife and children. Every one of them that day had some business to occupy him with.

How low is their way of thinking by glorifying something that is despicable and helpless.

If the heavens and the earth are all in His hands, then who else is greater, greater, more powerful than God? Do they magnify the statues when the statues are only a small part of the heavens and the earth? Regarding this verse, Imam al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn Mas'ud a hadith: One of the priests came to the Messenger of Allah and said to him, \"O Muhammad, I actually found (in our book) that Allah the Almighty placed the sky in one of finger, the earth on another finger, trees on another finger, water and earth on another finger, and other creatures on another finger, then He said, 'I am the king. The Messenger of Allah laughed at the priest's words so that his molars showed a sign of agreement. Then the Holy Prophet read this verse 67. Regarding the depiction of the heavens and the earth in His hands, perhaps it can be understood with the meaning that this world is in His power. We don't know what the real nature of the earth's condition is in God's hands. This includes unseen matters, which must be accepted as explained by Allah. What must be fully believed is that God cannot be likened to anything. God's Word: There is nothing like Him. And He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.

There were Allah's creatures who did not die at that time because Allah did not want their death, but who they were is not mentioned in the Qur'an, as well as in authentic hadiths. Therefore, we just leave the knowledge of this to Allah. Maybe He didn't mention His creatures that don't die because of some reason or wisdom that we don't know the essence of. However, according to a history from Abu Ya'la al-Maushuli, the creatures that do not die are the Angels Jibril, Mikail, and Izrail. After that, the creatures died one by one. After that first blast, in which nearly all living things died, followed by the second trumpet blast. With this second blast, all creatures that have died, both those who died before the first blow and those who died during the blow, come alive again. Each stood waiting to see what would happen to him. There are several hadiths regarding this trumpet blowing, including: 1. Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud. from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri namely: Rasulullah once mentioned about the one who blew the trumpet and said, \"On his right is Gabriel and on his left is Mikail.\" 2. The hadith narrated by Ibn Majah al-Bazzar and Ibn Mardawaih from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri namely: In fact, in the hands of the two trumpeters there are two horns that they will blow. The two of them always kept an eye on their surroundings, and whenever the two of them were ordered around. In addition, in the Qur'an the trumpet blast is called az-Zajrah, as mentioned in the verse: So the resurrection is only with one shout; then immediately they saw it. (ash-shaffat\/37: 19) And in the verse: Then the return is only with one blow. So instantly they came back to life on the (new) earth. (an-Nazi'at\/79: 13-14) In other verses it is also mentioned as \"dakwah\" (call), as in the verse: And among His signs (greatness) is the standing of the heavens and the earth with his will.

The highest trial which is quite complete with reliable witnesses whose truth cannot be disputed because each witness mutually supports the testimony of other witnesses. It is at that moment that the fate of every person is decided and determined based on the truth and it is absolutely impossible that a decision would be contrary to justice and could harm or cause someone to be mistreated. This is found in the verse: And We will set the right scales on the Day of Resurrection, so no one will be harmed even a little; even if it is only the weight of a mustard seed, We will certainly bring it (reward). And it is sufficient for Us to make calculations. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 47)"

No one protested the verdict and reply. Rejoice those who believe and do a lot of good deeds and wreak havoc and regret the disbelievers who during their lives in the world were always arrogant and arrogant and committed many sins and disobedience. In fact, there is no need for a very thorough and precise procedure and irrefutable witnesses, because all the deeds of Allah's servants are in the knowledge of Allah, the Most Extensive, and He is the absolute authority on that day. He can treat His servants according to His will without any proof of someone's guilt, but Allah, the All-Wise, wills that all the decisions that He determines can be seen by His servants at that time, all based on irrefutable evidence."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah explains that disbelievers who associate partners with Allah with others such as idols and other idols are herded into hell in a rough way. They were herded in groups by prioritizing the group that was the most misguided and lawless, then followed by the group with the lower level of rebellion and so on. Every one of the groups arrived at hell, the doors of hell were opened and they were pushed so hard that they fell into it. This is clearly illustrated in the following verse: Woe on that day to those who deny. Those who play in falsehood (sinful acts), on that day (when) they will be pushed into Hell with all their might. (It was said to them), \"This is the hell that you used to deny.\" (ath-thur\/52: 11-14) The gates of hell will be closed after all have entered it in the verse: Verily, the fire is sealed over (themselves), (while they are) tied to long poles. (al-Humazah\/104: 8-9) They were rebuked, reviled, and humiliated by the angels who held the keys to hell by saying had they not come to them Allah's apostles from among themselves who called to obey and obey Allah, and not associate partners with others? His with another. The apostle also reads to them the verses of Allah which prove the truth of his message with strong and clear evidence and explanations so that they cannot be refuted? Why did they reject his call with arrogance and arrogance? They cannot answer that question because they have already faced the fact that they will go to hell. They admit frankly that they are guilty of belittling Allah's Apostle because they are driven by lust, fear of losing influence, position, and so on. Such an acknowledgment is found in the following verse: Every time a group (unbelievers) are thrown into it, the guards (of hell) ask them, \"Has no one ever come to warn you (in the world)?\" They replied, \"Yes, indeed, a warner has come to us, but we deny (it) and we say, \"Allah did not send down anything, you are actually in great error.\" (al-Mulk \/ 67: 8 -9)"

They found the door wide open and there were waiting for the gatekeepers with great respect and wisdom while saying to them 'Assalamu' alaikum\". prepared for them in this paradise. Then they are respectfully invited to enter heaven immediately and it is said to them, \"You will remain in it forever and ever.\" The believers came in groups. The first group was the closest people to Allah and have the highest rank in His sight according to their faith, piety and good deeds in this world. The second group is people who are lower in rank than the first group. And so on until all the Muslims enter it. The door heaven is open for them as it is also mentioned in another verse: This is an honor (for them). And sun ugh, for those who fear Allah (provided) the best place to return, (namely) Paradise 'Adn whose doors are open for them. (shad\/38: 49-50) In that paradise they will get various kinds of pleasures and pleasures that no one in this world has ever thought of. Such favors and gifts can be achieved by various kinds of charity and worship performed by humans during their life in the world. Explained by the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Umar bin Khaththab that the Messenger of Allah once said Which of you who performs ablution perfectly then he says, \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and indeed Muhammad is the servant and messenger of Allah, surely Allah will eight gates of heaven were opened for him and he was allowed to enter from whichever door he liked. (Muslim history and others) It was also narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah once said: The first group to enter paradise will have faces like the full moon (on the fourteenth night). The next entourage had bright faces like the most brilliant stars in the firmament (the morning star). (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Al-Bukhari and Muslim also narrated from Sahal bin Sa'ad that the Messenger of Allah said: In that heaven there are eight doors, one of the doors is named ar-Rayyan. That door is only entered by people who are fasting.\""

And Allah's pleasure is greater. That's a great victory. (at-Taubah\/9: 72) And the word of Allah: O our Lord, give us what You have promised us through Your messengers.
