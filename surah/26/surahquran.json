By practicing the contents and contents of these verses, humans will definitely achieve happiness in this world and in the hereafter. This is believed to be true by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions who have believed. However, the Meccan infidels always rejected these teachings and made fun of them when the Prophet Muhammad called them to faith. They even ridiculed, insulted, and accused him of various kinds of accusations, such as declaring that Muhammad was crazy or a person who had been enchanted or a poet."

			"tafsir": "The Prophet Muhammad was a man who loved his people and always hoped that they would all believe. He believes that by embracing Islam, they will surely be happy and safe from the calamities that Allah used to send down to those who disbelieved before. He almost gave up because after all this time he had called on them with strong reasons and arguments that could not be refuted, they still disobeyed and humiliated him. It is very tragic and very sad for a religious leader who loves his people and tries for their safety and happiness, but is always ridiculed by his people. In this verse, Allah rebuked the Prophet Muhammad who was in the peak of sadness and sorrow by saying whether the Prophet would destroy himself just because his people did not want to accept the true guidance and teachings? It was as if Allah gave him a warning, why did the Prophet really hope that his people would all believe? Even though his main obligation is only to convey Allah's message as stated in His word: Isn't it the responsibility of the apostles to convey (God's message) clearly. (an-Nahl\/16: 35) Actually with this rebuke Allah forbade him to do so as mentioned in His word in another surah: Verily Allah misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not you (Muhammad) let yourself perish because of sorrow for them. Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. (Fathir\/35: 8)"

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that if Allah wanted to force them to believe, it would be very easy for Him. However, Allah wants to apply His sunnah to the Quraysh that believing is not by coercion and violence, but by self-awareness and will. Forcing people to believe is contrary to the verses of the Qur'an (al-Baqarah\/2: 256) and the sunna of Allah. This was not permitted by the apostles according to the word of God: And if your Lord had willed, all people on earth would have believed entirely. But do you (want to) force people so that they become believers? (Yunus\/10: 99). Therefore, Allah, with His wisdom and decree, sent messengers who would call upon the people to the truth and pure monotheism, and guide them to the straight path, and the Shari'ah that would lead them to happiness in this world and the hereafter. Thus Allah sent down the Qur'an to Muhammad as a miracle. The miracles of the Al-Qur'an will remain in effect throughout time until the Day of Judgment in accordance with the message that Muhammad brought to all mankind in all times and places. The miracles given to the prophets before Muhammad only apply to the time and place where the prophet spread his message. After that, the miracles were just news written in history and could not be witnessed again by generations that came later. In contrast to the Al-Qur'an, until now with increasing human knowledge, and the more advanced their technology, the truth of the Al-Qur'an will become clearer and clearer. Scientific hints mentioned in the Qur'an briefly, which may not have been understood in previous times, are increasingly being revealed, so that Muslims are increasingly convinced of the truth of the Qur'an. In this regard, there are also an increasing number of people who are self-aware that the Al-Qur'an is indeed a book sent down by Allah to guide people to the right path, so that they have faith and embrace Islam."

If they would think about and meditate on Allah's creation, they would certainly become people who believe in Allah and His Messenger. They will no longer worship idols that are not able to provide the slightest benefit and also prevent harm and harm, both for themselves and their worshippers. The disbeliever does not pay attention to the various kinds of colorful plants, each of which has its own specialties in terms of leaves, flowers and fruit. Even though they all grow in the same soil and are watered with the same water, they produce fruits that are different in shape, color and taste. Does this not show the power and wisdom of His Creator? However, if the heart is closed by feelings of pride and arrogance, the mind is influenced by greed to gain rank, position, and wealth, then all paths to reach the truth will be closed. Anything that goes against their will is all evil and ugly in their eyes. These are the factors that turn them away from thinking and meditating on Allah's power. Therefore, most of them remain in denial, disbelief, and always challenge the message and truth brought by the Prophet Muhammad. They always deny the Day of Judgment, the day of resurrection, and the day of reckoning, because they don't want to think about it. They just want to have fun in this world, so they feel it's pointless to think about how things will be after death. According to them, the dead body must have crumbled into the ground and will not return. In fact, God has the power to destroy them in various ways, just as God destroyed the rebellious ancients. Some were destroyed by typhoons and great floods, some were destroyed by violent earthquakes, and some were destroyed by thunderous noises. However, Allah has the nature of mercy and compassion. For this reason, Allah did not inflict on the polytheists of Mecca the torments that were inflicted on the former ummah, in the hope that there might be unbelievers who disobeyed and challenged them or their descendants who would believe. The Quran states that all inanimate and living things in the universe are created in pairs. The verse above gives an example of plants. However, actually the concept of pairing is not only in plants, but in almost all of their creations. In the Qur'an it is stated, among other things: \"Glory be to Him who has created pairs of all, both from what the earth and themselves grow and from what they do not know.\" (Yasin\/36: 36). \"And We have created everything in pairs...\" (adz-dzariyat\/51: 49)."

However, Musa (as) imagined how the Pharaoh's people had strayed from the right path. He also knows how hard and rude they are towards people who oppose their beliefs, while he himself feels like a weak and helpless person. Musa was very worried that Pharaoh's people would accuse him of being a liar and a liar. Moreover, if there was a fierce debate with Pharaoh and his people, Musa, who was not so eloquent in his tongue, would become nervous in giving proper and strong reasons, so that his chest would narrow when facing them. Musa complained about everything he felt to Allah and asked Him to appoint Harun as, his brother, to be an apostle to help and help him. Aaron is an eloquent person and is good at expressing what is in his heart in good and interesting language. This is also mentioned in another verse: He (Moses) said, \"O my Lord, expand my chest, and make my affairs easy for me, and remove the stiffness from my tongue, so that they understand my words, and make me a servant from my family, (namely) Aaron, my brother, strengthen my strength with (the presence of) him, and make him a friend in my affairs. (thaha\/20: 25-32). Similarly, it is stated in another of His words, namely: And my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent in tongue than I, so send him with me as my helper to justify my (sayings); indeed, I am afraid they will lie to me.\" (al-Qasas\/28: 34). Musa was worried that he would face Pharaoh and his people alone because he had accidentally killed a Qibthi (native Egyptian). This happened when Musa saw a fight that took place between the Qibthi people and a Bani Israel. He intended to help this member of his clan and hit the Qibthi so hard that he fell and died immediately. Musa was worried that he would be killed by Pharaoh's people because of this incident, so he could not convey his message. However, if Aaron was by his side and he was killed, then his brother could continue his message. So Musa's request that Aaron be appointed as an apostle to help him is not because he was afraid of death in conveying his preaching and treatise, but so that his preaching and treatise would not stop if he died, because it was continued by his brother, Harun."

He was surprised why the two of them were so daring to oppose his rule, while he himself considered himself a god for his people, including in this case the Children of Israel. Then Musa and Aaron also demanded the liberation of all the Children of Israel from the clutches of slavery. Pharaoh wondered why Musa had the courage to say two things that made no sense at all? Pharaoh knew very well that Musa was his foster son. Since childhood, he was educated and brought up in his palace. Pharaoh also knew that as an adult, Musa had killed a person close to him, namely his own cook when he fought with one of the Children of Israel. Pharaoh was also surprised why Musa, with such a biography, dared to challenge his authority and demanded things that did not make sense in his opinion. With a loud tone and unbearable anger, Pharaoh replied, \"Didn't we raise and educate you since childhood? We saved you from being killed where at that time we ordered that every male child of the Children of Israel must be killed. . We educated and raised them in our palaces, we love and care for them like loving and caring for our own children. However, now you are asking us for two things that are impossible to happen, namely that I step down from my divine throne and admit that you are an apostle of A God we don't know. Then you also ask that the Children of Israel who have lived in this land of Egypt for centuries be released and you take them to a land that you consider your ancestral land.

			"tafsir": "When Musa and Harun were allowed to appear before Pharaoh and confirm to him that they were both messengers of Allah, the Creator of the universe and asked that the Children of Israel be released from slavery and allowed to leave Egypt, Pharaoh was very surprised and felt astonished. He was surprised why the two of them were so daring to oppose his rule, while he himself considered himself a god for his people, including in this case the Children of Israel. Then Musa and Aaron also demanded the liberation of all the Children of Israel from the clutches of slavery. Pharaoh wondered why Musa had the courage to say two things that made no sense at all? Pharaoh knew very well that Musa was his foster son. Since childhood, he was educated and brought up in his palace. Pharaoh also knew that as an adult, Musa had killed a person close to him, namely his own cook when he fought with one of the Children of Israel. Pharaoh was also surprised why Musa, with such a biography, dared to challenge his authority and demanded things that did not make sense in his opinion. With a loud tone and unbearable anger, Pharaoh replied, \"Didn't we raise and educate you since childhood? We saved you from being killed where at that time we ordered that every male child of the Children of Israel must be killed. . We educated and raised them in our palaces, we love and care for them like loving and caring for our own children. However, now you are asking us for two things that are impossible to happen, namely that I step down from my divine throne and admit that you are an apostle of A God we don't know. Then you also ask that the Children of Israel who have lived in this land of Egypt for centuries be released and you take them to a land that you consider your ancestral land. This is a joke that is not funny and is stupid and stupid which shows that both of you are unscrupulous humans maybe even humans who have gone mad.\""

He just wanted to intervene and teach the baker a lesson not to be rude and insult the Children of Israel. He did beat him but did not intend to kill, because he could not bear to see the baker being so arrogant and insulting his people, the Children of Israel. If it is considered a mistake, then Musa admits that at that time he really made a mistake. Now he has changed, Musa has become an apostle who was given the task by Allah to invite Pharaoh and his people to true religious life. Musa was also given the task of freeing the Children of Israel from slavery that was not right, namely human slavery by humans. If Pharaoh mentioned his good merits for raising and educating Musa in the palace, this was due to Pharaoh's wisdom on his wife's desire to save him when his mother threw him into the Nile River.

I do not know that there is a God for you besides me. (al-Qasas\/28: 38) (24) In this verse, Allah explains Musa's answer to Pharaoh's question about the God that Moses acknowledged as the God who sent him. To make it easier for Pharaoh to understand what was being asked, Musa explained some of the characteristics that show God's power over all the worlds, according to the purpose of Pharaoh's question. Musa said that God who sent him was the God who created the heavens and the earth and what -what is between the two as best as possible.God who made the sun, the moon, the sparkling stars in the sky, the rivers, the seas, the mountains, the trees hon, the animals, the plants of the earth, the wind, air, and other things that exist between the heavens and the earth.

It is to Him that man must devote himself. The belief in monotheism is based on several sound reasons. The mission brought by the Prophet Abraham, was also carried by the previous prophet, Noah. All the prophets and apostles carried such an important task. Besides inviting people to unite with God, they are also openly hostile to every form of worship that in principle associates partners with God. Prophet Noah also opposed his people who intended to harm him due to his call to believe, as described in the word of Allah: Therefore make up your mind and gather your allies (to destroy me), and do not keep your decision secret. Then act upon me, and do not delay any longer. (Yunus\/10: 71) Likewise the word of Allah explains the words of the Prophet Hud as: He (Hud) replied, \"Indeed I bear witness to Allah and witness that I am free from what you associate with.

Allah is the creator of humans, with the best creation. He also gives instructions (guidance). As you know, guidance is diverse. There is guidance called the guidance of the five senses, guidance of reason (mind), guidance of instinct (intelligence that is brought from birth), and guidance of religion (ad-din). Reason is God's guidance which is very valuable, because with reason humans are able to distinguish between bad and good. Reason is what distinguishes humans from animals. However, reason alone is not a guarantee for human safety. Therefore, Allah completes his favor by giving them religion. Religious guidance is only God who gives it. If someone is desired by Allah to obtain guidance (religion), no one can stop him. On the other hand, if Allah has not willed it that way, no one can provide guidance. Even the prophets and apostles themselves who were assigned to bring guidance also did not have the authority to give guidance as seen in the story of the Prophet Abraham in another verse (surahh al-An'am\/6: 74-88) which tells of a dialogue between him and his father ( azar) and his people. Ibrahim tried to convert his father to Islam, but Allah did not give guidance, so he remained in polytheism. Likewise, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad, Abu Talib, who has contributed a lot in developing the Prophet's da'wah in Mecca. The Prophet really wanted his uncle to convert to Islam, but Allah had not given guidance so that he remained polytheist until the end of his life.

Even so, humans also have to find out how to get that healing. Imam Jamaluddin al-Qasimi in his commentary describes that this verse describes the morality of a servant of Allah to his Creator. Because disease is sometimes the result of human actions themselves, for example caused by violations of health norms, or daily lifestyle, disease attacks on the body cannot be avoided. On the other hand, the one who has the right to cure the disease is Allah alone. If a sick person feels this way when he is sick, then he will really appreciate God's blessings after he recovers from the disease. The fact proves that most people get sick due to lack of attention to the prevailing health norms."

If it is questioned, death is also sometimes the result of human actions themselves, while in this verse Allah emphasizes that He Himself is the one who kills humans, so how do we distinguish between death attributed to Allah and sickness caused by humans? Death is a decree that definitely applies to all people without exception, while special pain befalls someone. This means that not all people suffer from a type of disease, each of them suffers from a different disease. Often people die suddenly, without being preceded by illness. It is clear that death is general in nature, on the contrary, a special illness befalls a person."

In relation to this Abrahamic prayer, wisdom is interpreted as knowledge about the attributes of divinity and knowledge about the truth that will be practiced in everyday life. Apart from that, he also prayed to be included in an environment of good people, and among groups who always put their trust in Him. This request was granted by Allah, as stated in another verse: And verily in the hereafter he will be among the pious. (al-Baqarah\/2: 130) Narrated in a hadith, Rasulullah prayed like the prayer of the Prophet Abraham, namely: \"O Allah, kill us in a state of Muslims, revive us in a state of Muslims, and enter us into the group of pious people, not among those who are despicable and afflicted by calamity (fitrah).\" (Ahmad's history from Rifa'ah bin Rafi')"

(as-saffat\/37: 108-110). Allah's promise in the verse above is proven true in the pages of prophetic history. Lots of descendants of the Prophet Abraham who became prophets and messengers of Allah, both from the descendants of Ishmael or from the descendants of Isaac. The major religions in the world (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) each classify their religion to the Prophet Abraham. Therefore, he is glorified and respected by various religions in their own way. Based on this information, it is natural for them to think that Abraham was a Jew (according to Jewish confessions). Likewise, Abraham is seen as a Christian (according to Christian religious beliefs), because Isa Almasih, the son of Maryam, is also a descendant of the Prophet Abraham. Strictly speaking in prophetic history, he is considered the father of the prophets. However, all allegations that Abraham was a Jew or a member of a certain religion are not true. The Qur'an refutes this belief: Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a straight man, a Muslim and he was not one of the polytheists. (ali 'Imran\/3: 67) The meaning of good speech in this prayer is the Prophet Muhammad. He is indeed a descendant of Prophet Ibrahim (from Ismail's side) who was the last to be appointed as a prophet and apostle. The treatise of the Prophet Muhammad (and also the prophets) is a treatise on the religion of monotheism. Rasulullah himself in a hadith said: I am (the implementation of the prayer of Ibrahim).

Prophet Noah and his followers began to build ships. His people were astonished and amazed to see what he was doing. They didn't know what Noah was doing. His people considered Noah and the believers, especially those who helped build the ship, to have gone mad. Everyone who passed near Prophet Noah made the ship mock and ridicule his deeds. Allah's command for Noah to build a ship and the attitude of Noah's people is explained in His words: \"And build the ship under the supervision and guidance of Our revelation, and do not talk to Me about the wrongdoers. In fact, they will be drowned. \" And he (Noah) began to build ships. Every time the leader of his people walked past him, they jeered at him. He (Noah) said, \"If you ridicule us, then we (also) will ridicule you as you ridicule (us). Then later you will know who will be overwritten by a humiliating punishment and (who) will be overwritten by eternal punishment.\" (Hud\/11: 37-39). The ridicule was answered by Prophet Noah by reminding them of Allah's punishment that will befall on unbelievers who do not heed the call of His messenger. If they always behave like that, then the doom will come soon. At the time of receiving the doom and calamity, they will regret it forever. However, regret is of no use anymore because all the doors of repentance have been closed for them. Allah reminded Prophet Noah not to serve these wrongdoers anymore, because their faith could no longer be relied upon, and it was Allah's decree to destroy them. Prophet Noah and those who believed with him had tried earnestly to carry out God's command to build the ship. After it was finished, came the moments promised by Allah, namely destroying the disbelievers and saving the believers. At that moment, the earth emitted water from all around and overflowed, like the overflow of water boiling in a cooking cauldron. In a short time, the water has submerged the earth's surface. At that time, Allah ordered Prophet Noah to order the believers to board the ship with the necessary equipment. Allah also ordered them to bring their pets, a male and a female each, so they could breed later after the typhoons and floods stopped. According to some commentators, the only family of Noah who joined the ship was a believing wife and three sons, namely Sam, Ham and Yafits. Thus Prophet Noah began to sail by mentioning the name of Allah, wading through floods like the sea, crossing waves that towered like mountains."

			"tafsir": "In the Qur'an it is described how big the wave was and how Prophet Noah tried to save his infidel son. He called him to board the ship with the believers. However, he ignored the invitation so that the son of Noah drowned with the other unbelievers. The story is mentioned in the word of God: And the ship sailed and carried them into the waves like the mountains. And Noah called his son, when he (the child) was in a remote place, \"O my son! Get on (to the ship) with us and do not be with the disbelievers.\" He (his son) replied, \"I will seek refuge in a mountain that can save me from the flood!\" (Nuh) said, \"There is nothing that protects from Allah's torment today except Allah, the Most Merciful.\" And the waves become a barrier between the two; then he (the child) is one of those who drowned. (Hud\/11: 42-43). Prophet Noah's ship sailed in a direction unknown to its passengers. Only Allah knows its purpose. At God's appointed time, the typhoon stopped and the flood receded, as if the water had been swallowed up by the earth. Prophet Noah's ship was stranded on a hilltop called Judi. Most commentators are of the opinion that Mount Judi is located in Southern Armenia which borders Mesopotamia which is famous for Mount Arafat. With the end of the typhoon and the great flood, and the anchoring of Noah's ship safely on Mount Judi, it means that Allah has kept His promise. He saved the believers, who followed Noah's call, and destroyed the disbelievers, who ignored his call. After the ship was anchored, Prophet Noah remembered his son who had drowned. He asked for safety for his son because he was part of his family. However, Allah reminded Prophet Noah that his son was no longer his family because he had become an infidel. Allah said: And Noah begged his Lord, saying, \"O my Lord, indeed my child is one of my family, and Your promise must be true. You are the most just judge.\" He (Allah) said, \"O Nuh! Indeed he is not one of your family, because his actions are really not good, therefore do not ask Me for something that you do not know (the essence). I advise you so that (you) are not among the ignorant.\" .\" (Hud\/11: 45-46). Those who believed with Prophet Noah who survived the typhoon and flood then multiplied, up to today's humans. Among them there are believers and some are unbelievers. There are those who are punished in this world so that they perish, and some are saved. Some are happy and some are miserable, some are rich and some are poor. Allah said: It was said, \"O Nuh! Come down safely and full of blessings from Us, for you and for all the people (believers) who are with you. And there are people whom We give pleasure (in the life of the world), then they will be punished We are sore.\" (Hud\/11: 48)."

There is no historian who can confirm the heyday of the 'ad' kingdom. Some estimate that the kingdom of the 'ad was as old as the Babylonian empire, which is about 2000 years before Christ. However, this is not in accordance with reality because the Prophet Hud was sent to the ad people before the Prophet Abraham was sent to Babylon, namely during the time of Nebuchadnezzar."

With regular irrigation, their land becomes fertile so that their prosperity increases. They built the city of Iram with tall and majestic pillars as the capital of their kingdom. Its founder was named Shaddad bin 'ad, one of their kings. Around this city, they built strong fortifications to defend it from enemy attacks. The prosperity and power that they have makes them arrogant and arrogant. They think that their condition will last forever. They disobeyed Allah by worshiping idols and doing whatever they wanted. Allah said: So as for the people of 'Ad, they were arrogant on earth without (paying heed to) the truth and they said, \"Who is more powerful than us?\" Do they not see that it is Allah who created them. He is greater in strength than them? And they have denied Our signs. (Fussilat\/41: 15)."

In another of his words, Prophet Hud threatened his people by saying that if they persisted in their denial, they would be destroyed by Allah and replace them with other people, who would rule and become the forerunners of future generations. While they will not be able to bring the slightest harm to Allah. Allah said: So if you turn away, then indeed, I have conveyed to you what is my duty as an apostle to you. And my Lord will replace you with another people, while you cannot bring Him the slightest harm. Verily, my Lord is the Sustainer of all things.\" (Hud\/11: 57). Among these 'ad there were those who believed in Prophet Hud, but most of them remained in denial. These 'ad who did not believe were destroyed by Allah by bringing a wind that was very cold, until they died lying in bed, their cities and countries collapsed and were buried in the ground, as Allah said: As for the people of 'ad, they were destroyed by a very cold typhoon, Allah caused the wind to fall on them for seven nights and eight days continuously, then you saw the people of 'ad at that time dead lying like empty (rotted) palm tree trunks. So did you see anyone who was still left among them? (Al-haqqah\/69: 6- 8). The people who do not believe and are destroyed by Allah are called 'Ä€d al-Â¸la ('ad the first). As for those who believe and are saved by Allah together with Prophet Hud are called 'ad ats-saniyah ('ad second). Among those who believed there were those who moved with the Prophet Hud to the south, namely Hadramaut. Until now in that area there is still a city called Medina Qabri Hud, which is located east of the city of Tariem, one of the largest cities in the Hadramaut. In Medina Qabri Hud there is a grave named Qabri Hud, which is enshrined until now, to be proof of the truth of the story of Hud mentioned in the Qur'an. Even though the land of the 'ad people was buried under the ground as a result of Allah's punishment, there are still signs that the place was once inhabited by highly cultured humans. In the Al-Qur'an there are many verses that instruct people to travel the earth to pay attention to the former settlements of people who have been destroyed by Allah, among them the Hud, to serve as a lesson. In the 20th century there came expeditions led by Western scholars, among them led by H. St. John Philby, who was able to organize an expedition to ar-Rub' al-Khali with the permission of the King of Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz Alu Su'ud. He wrote a book called The Heart of Arabia. A Dutch scholar, Van der Mulen, also led an expedition around ar-Rab' al-Khali, and wrote a book called Hadramaut. The story of Prophet Hud and his people is only mentioned in the Qur'an, not found in other Divine books. In the story of the Hud people there is a lesson for Muslims, because those who were destroyed were those who did not believe."

In other words, Prophet Saleh and the Samud people both came from Samud descent. According to one history, Samud is 'ad's biological son, while according to another history, Samud is 'ad's cousin. Even though there are such differences, it can be determined that between the Samud and the 'ad people still have a close relationship. samud was the son of Aus bin Aram bin Sam bin Nuh. The Samud live in the city of hijr (Mada'in salih) up to Wadil Qura, which is a place located between Hejaz and Syam, in the southeast of Madyan country. Their legacy is still present in this area, which in general can show how their power used to be and how much prosperity they have achieved.

To strengthen his preaching, Prophet Saleh stated that there is no god but Allah who created them, provided sustenance, gave life and death, and made them merchants, shepherds, businessmen, and prospers of the earth, as Allah said: And to the Samud (We sent ) their brother, Saleh. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, there is no god for you but Him. He has created you from the earth (soil) and made you prosperous, therefore ask forgiveness from Him, then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is very near (mercy) Him) and allow (the prayer of His servant)\". (Hud\/11: 61). Prophet Saleh explained the reason, namely that Allah had created them from the earth, namely from the ground. This is something real to them, they can't deny it. Prophet Saleh also said that Allah had made them the prosperity of the earth. This is a reality for them too. They have indeed prospered the earth by utilizing water sources, building irrigation which functions to regulate the distribution of water, until their land becomes fertile, their crops grow and bear fruit, and their livestock live well. They have also removed metals from the soil that are beneficial to companies and commerce. In this way, they have cultivated and prospered the earth, and this is something they actually live out every day. Nabi Saleh explained that he would not ask them for any wages.

Prophet Saleh threatened them by saying that they would soon be punished by Allah if they disturbed the camel. According to the commentators, the miraculous aspects of the camel are: 1. The camel came out of the rock, while the other camels did not. 2. The sources of drinking water for the inhabitants are divided in half between the camels and the inhabitants of the country. On the day the camel drank, residents were not allowed to take water. To meet the needs of drinking water, they are allowed to milk the camel. When it is the turn of the people to fetch water, the camels do not come to drink water there. 3. On the day the camel drank, the other animals did not come to that place. The extraordinary nature of the camel is a clear testament to Saleh's apostleship. They will be destroyed by Allah, if they disobey His commands regarding the camel. They ignored Prophet Saleh's prohibition so that they would not touch and disturb the camel, they even wanted to prove the truth of Prophet Saleh's words. Therefore, they wanted to kill him and challenge what had been threatened against them. Prophet Saleh said that they would be destroyed by Allah after three days had passed because of the act of killing the camel."

			"tafsir": "(157-159) This verse explains that the Samud people wanted to prove the truth of Prophet Saleh's words, then they killed the camel. However, after they slaughtered the camel, especially after seeing signs that Allah's punishment was coming, they regretted it. Especially when their earth was shaken by an earthquake and accompanied by lightning and thunderbolts which caused their houses to be razed to the ground. In the Al-Qur'an there are verses that explain the punishments that destroy them. There are verses which explain that they were destroyed by sa'iqah (lightning) (Fussilat\/41: 17 and ad-dariyat\/51: 44). While other verses mention rajfah (shaking the earth very hard) (al-A'raf\/7: 78). In other verses it is called saihah (a very loud voice from the sky) (Hud\/11: 67; al-Hijr\/15: 83; and al-Qamar\/54: 31). There are also those who say that they were destroyed by Tagiyah (an extraordinary incident) (al-Haqqah\/69: 5). These verses are not contradictory because they are destroyed by lightning (Sa'iqah). As for the very loud shaking of the earth (rajfah), a loud sound from the sky (saihah), and extraordinary events (tagiyah) are symptoms and characteristics of lightning. The lightning was so great that it shook the earth and made a very loud sound. All this destroyed them and this was an extraordinary incident. In the twinkling of an eye, they had become motionless bodies, dead and slumped in their homes. Then they disappeared from the surface of the earth, nothing was seen except their place of residence, as if they had never lived and were in that place. Because they have been destroyed by Allah, then in history they are one of the Arab nations who have been destroyed (al-'Arab al-Ba'idah). Prophet Saleh and the believers were saved by Allah from that doom. They fled to Ramallah, a city in Palestine. In this city there is the grave of Prophet Saleh which is still known today. However, there are those who say that Prophet Saleh's grave is in Yemen, and there are also those who think that it is in Jordan. According to Ibn Khaldun, Prophet Saleh called his people to the religion of Allah for twenty years and he died at the age of fifty-eight. The lands of the Samud people and the buildings they erected are still there. Western scholars have visited this place a lot. They have written the remains of the Samud people and the residential houses they carved from the rocks. Among them is CM Daughty who wrote a book entitled Arabia Desserta. When the Prophet passed the villages of the Samud people on his expedition trip, namely Tabuk, he said to his companions: You do not enter the villages of those who have been punished, but by crying, if not by crying, then do not enter their villages, so that you will not be punished as it has befallen them. (History of ash-Shaikhan from Ibn 'Umar). Their remains and traces are enshrined in the Qur'an to serve as a lesson. Many verses of the Qur'an instruct people to travel on earth, to pay attention to the remains and traces of people who have been destroyed by Allah, because of their disobedience to His commands, like the Samud people. Truly Allah does good to all human beings, His punishment is very severe and His mercy is very great."

Their actions were considered to encourage others to do as they did. Allah said: And (remember the story of) Lot, when he said to his people, \"Why do you do fahisyah (abominable) deeds, when you see them (abominable immoral acts)?\" Why do you go to men to (fulfill) lust (you), not (go to) women? Indeed, you are a people who do not know (the result of your actions). (an-Naml\/27: 54-55). Besides practicing homosexuality, Prophet Lut's people also robbed and robbed the property of passers-by and carried trade goods. Same-sex practices (homosexuals and lesbians) are strictly prohibited by Islam. This practice is very unhealthy. This deviant sexual behavior causes many new diseases, such as AIDS and herpes. Both of these diseases were unknown several generations ago. But at present, both diseases have spread widely and rapidly. Homosexual practices, in addition to other deviant sexual behaviors, such as changing partners or practicing prostitution, are the most common ways of spreading the AIDS virus. This disease is mostly (90%) spread by means of deviant sexual behavior. Several other ways of transmitting AIDS are by means of blood transfusions that have been contaminated with the AIDS virus and the use of unsterile needles. Meanwhile, transmission from mother to fetus is not too large, which is below 10%. In a hadith, the Prophet Muhammad said: The act of adultery never occurs in a people, so they do it openly, unless they will be overwritten by infectious diseases and other diseases that did not exist in the community before. (History of Ibn Majah from Ibn Umar) From the hadith above, it can be seen that when humans start to engage in abnormal sexual behavior, new diseases will appear that have never existed before, and spread among humans. At present, we only understand what this hadith means, which was spoken by the Prophet Muhammad about 1400 years ago."

Therefore, they are asked to stop these actions, and fear Allah's punishment that will be inflicted on those who commit crimes. It is He who created everything that exists, including them.

Thus, they believe that the Qur'an came from God, not man-made. However, they deny the Qur'an, and deny the prophet who brought it. Their denial grew stronger, unshakable by anything. The desire to deny the Prophet and challenge him caused them to commit sinful acts, and they would only stop when the doom had befallen them. In another verse Allah says: And they deny it because of their tyranny and arrogance, even though their hearts believe in (the truth) of it. So see how the end of those who do damage.

Sometimes they praise something they once disapproved of, glorify something they once despised, and confess something they once denied the truth of. This proves that their goal in writing poetry is not to find the truth or to state something that is true. In compiling these verses, they only depended on imagination. The more their fantasies and dreams, the better the poetry they make. The poet's fallacy is only followed by misguided people, and will not be followed by people who like to seek the truth. 2. The poets often said what they did not. They suggest that humans are generous and generous, but they themselves are miserly and miserly. They often compose poems to offend other people's honor, such as criticizing, insulting, and so on, for any small reason. On the other hand, they often glorify and praise someone for small reasons. Such are the characteristics of poets who are reproached by God. However, there are also poets who are good-natured and quite knowledgeable. His poetry encourages the enthusiasm of others to do good, and contains wisdom, advice, and lessons. Among them is the poetry of Umayyah bin Abi as-salt, as follows: From 'Amr bin ash-Syirid, from his father, that he said, \"One day I took the Messenger of Allah on his back, so he asked me, 'Have you memorized some of the verses Umayyah bin Abi as-salt? I replied, 'Yes. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Read it immediately. So I recited one stanza. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Read it immediately. So I recited one more verse. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Continue. I continued until one hundred stanzas.\" (Muslim history) The Prophet's attitude towards Umayyah bin Abi as-salt's poetry shows that he liked poetry and poets, as long as the poet is a person who has morals, has lofty aspirations, and his poems contain many points of wisdom. Unlike the poets and poems whose characteristics are mentioned in the previous verses (verses 221-226). Such poets and poems were denounced and prohibited by the Prophet."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the misguided paths that have been taken by poets in composing their poetry, namely: 1. The poets compose poetry without a clear purpose. Sometimes they praise something they once disapproved of, glorify something they once despised, and confess something they once denied the truth of. This proves that their goal in writing poetry is not to find the truth or to state something that is true. In compiling these verses, they only depended on imagination. The more their fantasies and dreams, the better the poetry they make. The poet's fallacy is only followed by misguided people, and will not be followed by people who like to seek the truth. 2. The poets often said what they did not. They suggest that humans are generous and generous, but they themselves are miserly and miserly. They often compose poems to offend other people's honor, such as criticizing, insulting, and so on, for any small reason. On the other hand, they often glorify and praise someone for small reasons. Such are the characteristics of poets who are reproached by God. However, there are also poets who are good-natured and quite knowledgeable. His poetry encourages the enthusiasm of others to do good, and contains wisdom, advice, and lessons. Among them is the poetry of Umayyah bin Abi as-salt, as follows: From 'Amr bin ash-Syirid, from his father, that he said, \"One day I took the Messenger of Allah on his back, so he asked me, 'Have you memorized some of the verses Umayyah bin Abi as-salt? I replied, 'Yes. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Read it immediately. So I recited one stanza. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Read it immediately. So I recited one more verse. The Messenger of Allah said, 'Continue. I continued until one hundred stanzas.\" (Muslim history) The Prophet's attitude towards Umayyah bin Abi as-salt's poetry shows that he liked poetry and poets, as long as the poet is a person who has morals, has lofty aspirations, and his poems contain many points of wisdom. Unlike the poets and poems whose characteristics are mentioned in the previous verses (verses 221-226). Such poets and poems were denounced and prohibited by the Prophet."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that good and useful poetry and poets are those who have the following characteristics: 1. Faith in Allah. 2. Do good deeds. 3. Mention and glorify the name of Allah, thus increasing the stability of his faith in His greatness and oneness. 4. Encouraging believers to wage jihad, upholding Allah's religion, escaping from the persecution of those who are hostile to them and His religion. It was narrated by Ibn Jarir ath-Tabari and Ibn Abi Syaibah that when the verse above was revealed, Hassan bin Scythe, 'Abdullah bin Rawahah, and Ka'ab bin Malik came to the Prophet. They are in a state of crying and feeling sorry for themselves because they are among the poets. So the Prophet recited this verse (asy-Syu'ara'\/26: 227) to them. Since the beginning of this surahh, Allah has explained the arguments of reason about His power and greatness through the stories of the previous prophets and their people who were able to comfort the Prophet who was upset because of the attitude of his people. The stories also explain the proofs of the truth of the prophets sent by Him, the difference between fortunetellers and the Messenger of Allah, comparing bad poets and poets to praiseworthy poets and poets. This surahh closes with a stern warning addressed to those who oppose Allah's religion that they will one day know their place of return, which is hell, the pain of which is unimaginably painful."
