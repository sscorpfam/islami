(al-Qashash\/28: 58) When a country is about to be destroyed, then the punishment and punishment of Allah will come to the inhabitants of that country when they are unaware and do not expect it at all, because there were no signs beforehand. Sometimes the torment comes at night, when they are having fun, feeling safe like the people of the Prophet Lut. Sometimes it comes during the day, when they are resting, just like the Prophet Shu'aib's people. Allah said: ¦ Until when the earth is perfect in beauty, and decorated, and its owners think that they will definitely master it (pluck the results), come to it Our punishment at night or day, then We make (plants) it like a plant that has been sickled, as if it had never grown yesterday.

Allah's Word: O people of jinn and humans! Haven't apostles from your own circle come to you, they conveyed My verses to you and warned you about the meeting today? They replied, \"(Yes), we are witnesses for ourselves.\" But they are deceived by the life of the world and they have witnessed themselves that they are disbelievers.

(ar-Rahman\/55: 39) and His words: And those who sin do not need to be asked about their sins.

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that Allah has created Adam as who will be followed by his descendants. Regarding the creation of human beings, the Qur'an has narrated in detail, both the creation of the first human, namely Adam, as well as the creation of his descendants. Regarding the creation of Adam, the Qur'an has informed that the Prophet Adam was created through four stages before the stage of the exhalation of the spirit. The four stages are: a. Turab phase, b. Thin phase, c. Masnun pest phase, and d. Shalsal phase. Here's an explanation. First Phase: Soil Phase that has not been mixed with water (turab) There are several verses that explain this phase as found in surahh al-Kahf\/18: 37, al-hajj\/22: 5, ar-Rum\/30: 20, Fajir \/35: 11, Gafir\/40: 67, and Ali 'Imran\/3: 59. Two of the six places are in Madaniyah surahhs, namely Ali 'Imran\/3 and al-hajj\/22, the rest are in Makiyah surahs . One of these verses is: Indeed, the parable (creation) of Jesus is to Allah, like (the creation of) Adam. He created him from dust, then He said to him, \"Be!\" Then be that something. (Ali 'Imran\/3: 59). In one of the hadiths narrated from Abu Daud and at-Tirmidhi it is stated that the soil which was the main ingredient for creating Adam was taken from various types and colors of soil found in all layers of the soil. In the hadith it is stated: Allah created Adam from a handful (soil) taken from all corners of the earth. Therefore, the descendants of Adam correspond to the (color) of the earth. Among them there are red, white and black (al-Khazin II: 118). Human nature is also different, some are gentle and some are tough. The various colors of human skin are emphasized in surahh ar-Rum\/30: 22 which reads: And among His signs (greatness) is the creation of the heavens and the earth, the difference in your language and the color of your skin. Verily, in that there are signs for those who know. (ar-Rum\/30: 22) Second Phase: The Land Phase which is mixed with water (thin) This second phase occurs in 8 places in 7 surahhs, namely: al-An'am\/6: 2, al-A'raf\/7 : 12, al-Mu'minun\/23: 12, as-Sajdah\/32: 7, ash-shaffat\/37: 11, shad\/38: 71, 76, and al-Isra'\/17: 61. All are surahs - surahh Makiyah. One of these verses is: It is He who created you from the ground, then He determines your death (your death) ¦ (al-An'am\/6: 2) The thin or clay phase is the phase where after the soil is mixed with water. Because water is a prerequisite for all living things. Third Phase: Black Mud Phase (hama' Masnun) This phase occurs after the second phase lasts a long time so that it becomes black mud which smells and changes shape. This phase is mentioned three times in surahh al-hijr\/15, namely in verses 26, 28 and 33. Verse 26 reads: And indeed, We have created man (Adam) from dry clay from black mud which is given a shape. (al-hijr\/15: 26) The Fourth Phase: The Pottery Phase (shalshal kal Fakhkhar) This phase is narrated in the Qur'an in four places. Three places in surahh al-Hijr which coincide with the third phase. While the fourth is found in surahh ar-Rahman\/55: 14. In this surahh, Allah says: He created humans from dry soil like pottery. (ar-Rahman\/55: 14) Black mud (hama' masnun) is like in the third phase, then given a shape like a human being in a hollow or empty state. The human form created by Allah is the best form of the existing animals. In surahh At-Tin\/95: 4, Allah says: Indeed, We have created humans in the best possible form. (at-Tin\/95: 4) This condition (prospective human beings who have been formed) if dry because of the sun's heat, for example , called shalsal. So named because this object when blown by the wind will make a sound (shalshalah). After this phase, then enter the next phase, namely the phase of exhalation of the spirit where the \"figure\" from clay, with Allah's permission, finally becomes a living human being and can move which is called \"basyar\" (al-Khazin III: 64, al-Maragi XIV: 21)."

Besides that, there is another type of clothing that is spiritual in nature which is much better than the outer clothing earlier, because it can gather all kinds of goodness, namely piety to Allah. The words of the Prophet Muhammad saw: \"Be fearful of Allah, for indeed piety collects all goodness.\" (History of Abu Ya'la from Abu Sa'id) With that piety, Allah always gives us instructions to be able to overcome and get out of the difficulties we face. He will provide us with sustenance from unexpected directions and always facilitate our affairs, as Allah says: Whoever fears Allah, He will open a way out for him, and He will give him sustenance from a direction he does not expect. (ath-thalaq\/65: 2-3) Allah's Word: And whoever fears Allah, He will make it easy for him in his affairs. (Ath-thalaq\/65: 4) All the blessings that Allah has bestowed such as giving clothes are a sign for Allah's power and proving His goodness to the children and grandchildren of Adam as, so it is in place if we always remember Allah, are grateful for His blessings, stay away from Satan's invitations and not exaggerating in speech and so on."

They should always remember Allah, because if not, their hearts will be as rusty as iron rusts. Thus, they will have steel strength to face Satan's enticements and seductions and they will be saved from his deception and will not experience the bad fate that has been experienced by the parents of humans, namely Adam AS and his wife, so that both of them were expelled from heaven, their clothes fell off so that her nakedness is visible. Satan and his followers have been in constant hostility to Adam's children. He always peeps and notices, where there is their weakness, that's where he sticks his needle as a temptation and deception. He is a very dangerous enemy, because he sees them, while they do not see him. He is more dangerous than ordinary enemies that can be seen because external enemies can be known where they are and where they are headed, even more dangerous than enemies in disguise. He flows in the human body like the flow of blood, as the words of the Prophet Muhammad saw \"Surely the devil flows in the bodies of Adam's children and grandchildren as blood flows in the body\". (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Anas) Satan is no different than the danger of a disease that is invisible except with a microscope which is usually transmitted by flies or mosquitoes that are put into food and drink or into the human body through blood. It penetrates into the body unnoticed, which has very sad consequences, because it will be difficult to recover in a short time and there is a possibility that it will not heal at all. Unlike diseases that can be seen with the naked eye, such as scabies and so on, they can be treated quickly and can recover in a short time. Worries that have bad consequences like those mentioned above can occur only in humans who have little or no faith at all, because they are the ones who will become their prey and it is to them, Allah has made Satan as their owner."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah commands that humans wear adultery (clean, beautiful clothes) when entering mosques and performing worship, such as prayers, tawaf and others. What is meant by using adultery is wearing clothes that can cover the nakedness by fulfilling the requirements of the hijab. It is even more polite if the clothes are clean and good, they are also beautiful which can add to the beauty of a person in worshiping Allah, as is the custom of someone dressing up in beautiful clothes when going to places where people are invited and so on. So to go to places of worship to worship Allah is certainly more appropriate, even more important. This depends on one's will and ability, also depends on awareness. If someone only has one piece of clothing, it is sufficient to cover the nakedness in worship, that is sufficient. But if a person has quite a lot of clothes, then it is more important that he wears good ones. The Messenger of Allah has said \"When one of you prays, he should wear two cloths, because for Allah it is more appropriate for a person to dress up. If there are not two cloths, then one piece of cloth is enough to be used for prayer. Do not crowd in prayer, like crowds of people Jewish\". (History of ath-thabrani and al-Baihaqi from Ibn 'Umar) It was narrated from Hasan, the Prophet's grandson, that when he was going to pray, he wore the best clothes. When people asked him about this, he replied, \"God is beautiful, he likes beauty, so I wear nice clothes.\" In this verse, Allah regulates eating and drinking. If during the Jahiliyah era, people who performed Hajj only ate food that was filling, did not eat good and healthy food that could increase the nutrients and vitamins needed by the body, then with the revelation of this verse, the food and drink had to be nutritionally perfect and timed. eat it with good health. That way humans are stronger in doing worship. In this verse it is explained that wearing good clothes, eating good food and drinking useful drinks are in order to regulate and maintain health so that we can worship Allah well. Because body health has a lot to do with food and drink. Excessive food and drink results in disruption of health. Therefore, Allah forbids excessive eating and drinking. The excessive prohibition has several meanings, including: 1. Don't overdo it in the portion of eating and drinking itself. Because, eating and drinking with excessive portions and beyond the limits will bring disease. Eat when you feel hungry, and when you do eat, don't get too full. Likewise with drinks, drink if you feel thirsty and when thirst is gone, stop drinking, even though your appetite is still there. 2. Don't go overboard in shopping to buy food or drinks, because it will bring losses. If spending is greater than income, it will cause a lot of debt. Therefore, everyone must try not to get too big on the stake from the pole. 3. Including too much is eating and drinking which is forbidden by Allah. In this case the Prophet had said: \"Eat, drink, give alms, and dress in a way that is not arrogant and not excessive. Indeed, Allah likes to see the use of His favors on His servants.\" (History of Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi and al-hakim from Abu Hurairah) Excessive deeds that go beyond the limits are not only destructive and harmful, but also Allah does not like them. Any work that is not pleasing to God, if it is done too, will certainly bring danger."

			"tafsir": "The Arabs during the time of ignorance, especially from the Bani Amir tribe, had forbidden wearing clothes when circumambulating the Kaaba, had forbidden some foods during Hajj such as eating meat, eating fatty foods and so on. Even Christians and Jews, some of them also forbid eating good things like the actions of the Arabs during the time of ignorance. So this verse strictly instructs the Prophet Muhammad, to ask them, who made all of this forbidden? It is clear that those who forbid it are themselves, not a revelation that Allah conveyed to His Messenger. Clothing and jewelry have indeed been provided by Allah for them and Allah does not forbid good, delicious food such as halal sustenance from Allah. Wearing beautiful clothes, dressing up and decorating, and eating delicious food that is lawful for Allah is a human pleasure and hobby. Islam allows it, as long as it does not conflict with God's law. Leaving such pleasures and hobbies does not include worship and drawing closer to Allah. A penchant for wearing good clothes and a penchant for eating good and lawful food will encourage people to think dynamically and creatively to improve agriculture, make irrigation, and increase progress in the industrial sector, such as yarn factories, cloth factories, increase the maintenance of animals, such as sheep. sheep, silkworms, livestock and others. Furthermore, in this verse, Allah ordered the Messenger of Allah to convey to His people, that decorating and dressing up in nice and beautiful clothes, as well as eating good and delicious food is permissible for those who believe in life. them in this world, it is also permissible for non-believers. But on the Day of Judgment, such enjoyment is exclusive to those who believe. Unbelievers have no right to enjoy it. All human beings have the right to live happily, to enjoy all kinds of good and lawful gifts from God while living in this world. The Prophet said: \"People (believers) who eat good food and are good at being grateful, are on the same level as fasting people who are patient with hunger.\" (History of Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa'i and al-Hakim from Abu Hurairah). Allah's Word: And whoever turns away from My warning, then indeed, he will live a narrow life, and We will collect him on the Day of Resurrection blind. (thaha\/20: 124) At the end of this verse it is explained that Allah has explained His verses for people who know. Among other things, in this verse, it is explained about the etiquette of dressing and eating, which some people do not know about, and even consider it a minor problem. Even though eating and drinking in moderation is the basis of health. If the body is not strong and not healthy, all work will not be carried out, either to seek life, or to worship Allah. Likewise dressing and dressing, is a sign of happiness and well-being and is also closely related to health. People who dress up and dress well, are honorable and commendable, as long as they dress up and dress well with good intentions, not to boast. The Messenger of Allah said: I came to the Messenger of Allah, wearing bad clothes, so the Messenger of Allah asked, \"Do you have any wealth?\" I replied, \"Yes,\" Rasulullah SAW asked again, \"What treasures?\" I replied, \"Allah gave me camels, goats, horses and slaves.\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"If Allah has given you wealth, then you should be able to see the traces of Allah's favor and His glory to you.\" (Narrated by Abu Dawud from Abu al-Ahwash from his father)."

What Allah has forbidden is not what the polytheists have forbidden for whom there is no reason or no revelation has come down to make it illegal, but they just make it up, such as forbidding wearing clothes during tawaf or forbidding eating meat during pilgrimage. In fact, what Allah has forbidden in this verse must be completely avoided, because the danger is very great, both for those who do it and for all mankind, Allah's prohibitions are as follows: 1. Doing abominable acts outwardly or secretly, including into heinous acts such as adultery, homosexuality, disgusting and dirty acts that lead to grave sins. 2. Acts that cause sin, such as drinking khamr, gambling and others. 3. Acts that exceed the limits, abuse fellow human beings, and violate personal rights or shared rights. 4. Associating partners with Allah, this is the most heinous act and is a great sin that will not receive forgiveness from Allah. Associating something with Allah, such as with idols, grave stones, wooden trees and others, shows a stupid act without using reason and mind. 5. Making laws that are not commanded by Allah or twisting the law, what is lawful is said to be haram and what is unclean is said to be halal. Actions like this are strictly prohibited by Allah, because they can lead to wrong religious understanding or can turn true religious beliefs into false religions. From actions like this, divisions in religion arise, they claim to know about religious matters, but what they really have is no knowledge, instead they are fooling other people. Deliberately or unintentionally, contrived works like this are prohibited by Allah, let alone to determine a law in Islam. In order to determine the law, there must be real evidence, either from the Qur'an or the mu'tabarah sunnah, it cannot be guessed or just guessed at.

What determines is Allah according to His sunnah and His will. The term of death refers to the time when punishment will fall for people or nations who have disobeyed, do not want to accept the truth, act arbitrarily at will, and do not hesitate to do what is abominable and unjust. So there are two kinds of provisions for the punishment, namely the first: the people are destroyed until they disappear from the surface of the earth. Like the havoc that Allah has sent down to Noah's people, 'Ad, Thamud, Pharaoh, Lut and others. The people have disappeared from the surface of the earth because of their iniquity and denial by not accepting the teachings brought by each of the apostles. They have been warned many times, but they don't believe it, and are even more rebellious and arrogant. Then came their end with destruction and annihilation until they were destroyed. Allah's Word: And this will be the torment of your Lord when He torments (the inhabitants of) countries that do wrong. Truly, His torment is very painful, very heavy. (Hud\/11: 102) Punishment which is a destruction like this, only specifically applies to the previous peoples which will not happen again to the people of the Prophet Muhammad, because the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad is a blessing for all inhabitants of this world. Allah said: And We did not send you (Muhammad) but to (become) a mercy to all the worlds. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 107) The second stipulation: the ummah becomes despicable, poor, stupid, colonized, and so on. Allah sent down the doom not to destroy it, but that the people lost their greatness and glory, fell into a lowly people, no longer worth and no glory. Many historical facts have shown that the people who were initially victorious and honorable, eventually became despicable and destitute, because they were extravagant in wasting their wealth for immorality. Behaving arbitrarily, torturing fellow human beings, spending the property of the people in an improper way, either through corruption, cheating and so on. Shirk disease spreads profusely, besides worshiping Allah, they also worship His creatures. Then comes the death of that people or nation, they become a people who are weak and despicable in the eyes of humans. The coming of doom cannot be postponed even for a moment nor can it be brought forward. No one knows when the doom will come, whether it is at night or during the day, sometimes it comes suddenly, when the people are off guard, are forgetting their roots, are having fun, Allah's punishment will come down suddenly -abruptly. If they had known when death would come, they would have asked for a postponement, and they would have immediately corrected their mistakes, and left behind abominations and sins and so on. The sudden arrival of death gives an understanding that God is Almighty and cannot be hindered or matched by human power. Finally the people regretted, but the regret was useless."

To deny Allah's verses means to reject, mock and ridicule them, their actions are considered the most unjust, they will enjoy the pleasures of this world for a while, but in the hereafter they will be punished with a very painful punishment.

(Luqman\/31: 24) When the wrongdoer enjoys the pleasures of this world, it suddenly ends, because his death has come when the angel of death comes to take his soul. It was only then that regret arose, when the angel asked him the question, which are the people you have been calling for all this time, you worship, ask for help and do not want to worship and ask God for help?

Have you received punishment and torment?\" They replied, \"Yes, we are receiving punishment, as has been threatened to us by the intercession of His Messenger.\" In the midst of such a conversation, one exclamation was heard from an angel who said, \"God's curse on unjust people who abuse themselves who don't want to receive God's love while in the world, namely entering heaven that God has promised.\""

			"tafsir": "This verse explains, who is meant by unjust people. Namely people who always try to forbid themselves or others to follow the way of Allah as Allah's Apostle has conveyed. Prohibits following true religious teachings, to seek the pleasure of Allah. Trying to mislead others from the right path. Apart from that, including people who are unjust, are people who try to distort religious teachings, not according to true teachings. The methods they use for this purpose vary. One of the biggest sins is shirk. Monotheism is transformed into shirk by mixing the teachings of monotheism with the teachings of other religions in worship and prayer. Associating partners with Allah with idols and other things or by making idols as washilah to Allah, these actions are considered shirk and are clearly prohibited. Allah's Word: Even though they are only ordered to worship Allah sincerely obeying Him solely for (carrying out) religion, and also to carry out prayers and pay zakat; and that is the straight (true) religion. (al-Bayyinah\/98: 5) Another way is to create all kinds of doubts in religion, they complicate excessive ways to carry out various religious orders. So that people will gradually run away from religion. In fact, the wrongdoers are those who do not believe in the afterlife. They do not believe in the coming of the Day of Judgment, do not believe in the Day of Judgment and other things related to the Day of Judgment."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that between the inhabitants of heaven and the inhabitants of hell there is a very solid boundary. The boundary is in the form of a wall that does not allow each of them to get out and to change places. Above the wall there is a highest place, where people who have not been put into heaven. They hang there waiting for a decision from God. From that high place they can see the inhabitants of heaven and see the inhabitants of hell. The two occupants were familiar with the markings on each of them. Like knowing his face which Allah has characterized in the Qur'an. Allah's Word: On that day there will be faces that are radiant, laughing and joyful, and on that day there will be (also) faces covered with dust (gloomy), covered with darkness (overwritten by humiliation and distress). They are the rebellious disbelievers. ('Abasa\/80: 38-42) Those who live in a high place above the boundary fence have good that is balanced with their evil, cannot yet be put into heaven, but will not become residents of hell. They are temporarily placed there, while waiting for God's mercy and grace to be able to enter heaven. It was narrated from Ibn Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah said: \"Put the scales on the Day of Judgment and then weigh all the good and evil. So those whose scales of good weigh more than the scales of evil, even if they are the size of a mustard seed\/atom, will enter heaven.\" And the one whose scales of evil outweigh the scales of his goodness even as big as a mustard seed\/atom, he will go to hell. It was said to the Messenger of Allah, how is a person whose scales of good are equal to the scales of evil? The Messenger of Allah replied: they are the residents of A'raf, they have not yet entered heaven but they really want to enter it.\" (Ibn Jarir's History from Ibn Mas'ud) After that Ibn Mas'ud said, \"in fact the scales can be heavy and can be light by a small seed. Those whose scales of good and evil are equally heavy, they are residents of A'raf, they stand waiting on the bridge. Then they turned away to see the inhabitants of heaven and hell. When they see the inhabitants of heaven, they say: \"Safety and prosperity to you. When their eyes are turned to the left, they see the inhabitants of hell, saying, \"O our Lord, do not put us together with the wrongdoers.\" They both take refuge in Allah from where they are.\" Ibn Mas'ud said, \"Those who have goodness, they are given a light that illuminates their front and right. Each person and each community is given light when they arrive on the bridge, Allah extinguishes the light of male hypocrites and female hypocrites. When the hosts of heaven see what is in front of the hypocrites, they say, \"Our Lord, perfect our light.\" As for the inhabitants of A'raf, their light is in their hands, it will not be lost. At that time Allah said: They have not been able to enter, but they want to (enter). (al-A'raf\/7: 46) What is meant in this verse, is that the inhabitants of A'raf call on the inhabitants of heaven, wishing them good luck, because of their longing for the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon the inhabitants of heaven. They have not yet been able to enter it, while their hearts are longing to enter."

They are always proud that those who live rich and noble and have power in this world are the ones who will be happy in the hereafter and will be spared from Allah's punishment. This is explained by Allah in His word: And every time We send a warner to a country, people who live luxuriously (in that land) say, \"We completely deny what you convey as a messenger.\" And they said, \"We have more wealth and children (than you) and we will not be punished.\" (Saba\/34: 34-35) The inhabitants of A'raf recognized them by the signs that were on them, such as those with black and dusty faces and signs that could be recognized while living in the world, such as the leaders of the Quraysh and their groups who became an enemy of Islam, and always oppressed and persecuted Muslims, including Abu Jahal, Walid bin Mugirah, Ash bin Wail and others.

By doing things like this it means that they are waiting for God's punishment to come which results in regret. On the Day of Judgment, what they were waiting for will come true.

			"tafsir": "At the beginning of this verse Allah confirms that He is the one who created the heavens and the earth in six days (mas). He is the Owner, Ruler and Ruler, He is God who has the right to be worshiped and to Him humans must ask for help. Even though what is mentioned in this verse is only the heavens and the earth, what is meant is everything that exists in this nature, because what is meant by the heavens is all the realms above, and what is meant by the earth is all the realms below, and this includes the natural world. that is between the heavens and the earth as stated in His word: Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, then He dwells on the Throne. (al-Furqan\/25: 59) What is meant by six days is the six periods that Allah has determined, not the six days that we know, namely the day after the creation of the heavens and the earth, while the day in this verse is before that. The following is an explanation of the meaning of the six days in this verse according to scientists: According to Marconi (2003) the explanation of the six periods is as follows: First Period, namely the time since the 'Big Bang' from the Singularity, until the separation of the Gravitational Force from the Single Force (Superforce) ), space-time begins to separate. However, the Space-Time Continuum that was born still exists in a vague form, where energy-matter and space-time are not clearly distinguished. The Second Period, the era when the inflation of the Greater Universe was formed, but the shape of this Greater Universe was still unclear, and was referred to as the Cosmic Soup. The Strong-Nuclear Force broke away from the Electro-Weak Force, and fundamental materials began to form: quarks, antiquarks, and so on. The Universe began to expand. The Third Period, the period of formation of atomic nuclei in this Universe. The Weak-Nuclear Force begins to separate from the Electromagnetic Force. Atomic nuclei such as protons, neutrons and mesons are composed of these quarks. This period is known as the formation of atomic nuclei (Nucleosyntheses). Space, time as well as matter and energy, began to appear separate. The Fourth Period, electrons begin to form, but are still in a free state, not yet bound by atomic nuclei to form stable atoms. The Fifth Age, the formation of stable atoms, the separation of matter and radiation, and the Universe, continues to expand and begins to appear transparent. The Sixth Age, the universe continues to expand, atoms begin to form aggregates into molecules, macro-molecules, then form proto-galaxies, galaxies, stars, solar systems, and planets. As for the length of a day according to religion, only Allah knows, because in the Qur'an itself it is explained that a day with Allah is equal to a thousand years, in His word it is stated: And verily a day with your Lord is like a thousand years according to your calculations. (al-hajj\/22: 47) And some are explained fifty thousand years as in His words: The angels and Gabriel ascended (facing) to God, in a day equivalent to fifty thousand years. (al-Ma'arij\/70: 4) There are several hadiths which show that the six days are our present days, among which are narrated by Ahmad and Muslim from Abu Hurairah. Abu Hurairah said: \"Rasulullah took my hand and said, \"Allah created land on Saturday, created hills on Sunday, created trees on Monday, created things that are not good on Tuesday, created light on Wednesday, created mountains on Thursday, and created Adam on Friday after Asar, is the last creation, at the last moment between the time of Asar and the beginning of the night.\" (Ahmad and Muslim's history from Abu Hurairah) This hadith is rejected by the experts hadith because it contradicts the text of the Qur'an. In terms of its sanad, this hadith is weak because it was narrated by Hajjad bin Muhammad al-Ajwar from Juraij who was insane at the end of his life. According to al-Manar this hadith is one of the Israiliyat hadiths that made by Jews and Christians and said to be from Rasulullah saw.In other verses it is explained in more detail about the periods of creation of the heavens and the earth as contained in fi rman Allah: Say, \"Should it be right for you to deny God, who created the earth in two ages and you also made partners for Him? That is the Lord of all the worlds.\" (Fushshilat\/41: 9) Allah creates solid mountains on the earth. He blesses and determines the food content of its inhabitants in the same (sufficient) four times according to who needs it. Then He goes to creation the heavens and the earth are still smoke, Allah said to him and to the earth, \"Come both of you according to My commands willingly or forced. The two replied, \"We came with likes.\" So He made seven heavens in two times and He revealed to each heaven its affairs. And We adorn the nearest sky with brilliant stars and We maintain it in the best way. Such is the provision of the Almighty, All-Knowing. From these verses it can be concluded as follows: 1. The creation of the earth from lumps that look like smoke are two times and the creation of land, hills, mountains and various kinds of plants and stars in two times also. Thus the creation of the earth and everything in it was complete in four times. 2. The creation of the sky from the clouds of mist and everything in it in two periods. As for how the process of the occurrence of heaven and earth. The Qur'an does not explain it in detail and it is incumbent on experts to investigate it and know the time or period required for each of the stages of its occurrence. Then after completing the creation of the heavens and the earth, Allah resides on the Throne managing and managing all matters related to the heavens and the earth in accordance with His knowledge and wisdom. Regarding how Allah resides on His Throne and how He governs the universe cannot be compared or described as the presence of a king on his throne because Allah cannot be compared or compared with His creatures. However, this must be believed and believed in and only Allah himself knows how it really is. None of the companions of the Prophet had doubts in their hearts about Allah's abode on the Throne. They believe that and have faith in Him without knowing how it is described. Thus Imam Malik said when he was asked about the problem of the residing of Allah on the Throne as follows, \"The residing of Allah is a familiar thing, but how to do it cannot be thought of.\" The apostleship is from Allah and the obligation of the Messenger is to convey it, so the human obligation is to justify it. Such is the opinion and position of the scholars from the past until now, so it is not natural for humans to dare to describe Allah's abode on His Throne. Na'im bin Ahmad teacher Imam al-Bukhari said about this, \"People who liken Allah to His creatures are infidels, people who deny the nature of Allah as described in His (in His book) are infidels, and nothing in the nature of Allah what He explained or His Messenger explained was something of an analogy. So whoever stipulates things received from valid hadiths according to the majesty of Allah and negates the qualities of deficiencies for Him, then surely he has taken the right path. Allah explains that it is He who covers the day and night so that the sun's light disappears on the surface of the earth and this happens very quickly. It means that the night always catches up with the sun's light when it is closed, there is night and in a place where the night has not yet been caught, the sun still illuminates it and there it is still day. This is how the alternation of day and night or the alternation of night and day continues. In another verse, Allah says: He created the heavens and the earth with the right (purpose); He causes the night to become the day and the day to the night, and subdues the sun and the moon, each running according to its appointed time. Keep in mind! He is the Most Glorious, Most Forgiving. (az-Zumar\/39: 5) This happens because the round earth always rotates on its axis under the sun. Thus, on the surface of the earth that is exposed to sunlight there is day and on the surface of the earth that is not exposed to sunlight there is night. Then Allah also explained that the sun, moon and stars are all subject to His commands and the rules that have been set. Everything moves according to predetermined rules and none of them deviates from those predetermined rules. Thus there will be harmony and harmony in each journey so that there will be no clashes or collisions between one another, even though in the sky there are an infinite number of stars and other celestial bodies. All of that is because He is the Creator, All-Knowing, All-Wise. Glory be to Allah the Lord of the worlds. Only Allah deserves to be worshiped, to Him every servant must pray for His grace and mercy and to Him also every servant must be grateful and grateful for all the blessings He has given. It's very far astray people who associate Him with His creatures and ask prayers for something that can not benefit or harm."

			"tafsir": "This verse contains ethics in praying to Allah. Prayer is a munajat between the servant and his Lord to convey a request so that Allah is pleased to grant it. So pray to Allah should be with humility, with a truly solemn and surrender. Then the prayer is said in a soft and gentle voice that comes from a clean heart. Praying in a loud voice eliminates solemnity and may lead to joy and other influences and can result in the prayer being not answered by God. Prayer does not have to be loud, because Allah is All-Hearing and All-Knowing. Narrated by Abu Musa al-Asy'ari, he said, \"When we were with the Messenger of Allah on the way, people were heard reading takbir in a loud voice. to the deaf and distant. Verily you call on Allah, the All-Hearing, Close and He is always with you.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Musa al-Asy'ari) Loud voices in prayer can disturb people, especially people who are praying, whether in mosques or in other places of worship, except for those that are permitted to speak loudly, such as talbiyah during the pilgrimage season and reciting takbir on Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Allah praised Prophet Zakaria as who prayed in a soft voice: (That is) when he prays to his Lord in a soft voice. (Maryam\/19: 3) Then this verse closes with a warning, \"Indeed, Allah does not like those who transgress limits.\" That is, it is forbidden to transgress in all respects, including praying. every thing has a set limit that must be considered, not to be exceeded. Being loud and exaggerating in prayer includes exceeding limits, Allah does not like it. This includes exceeding limits in b praying, asking for something that is impossible according to syara' or reason, like someone asking that he be rich, but doesn't want to try or someone wants his sins to be forgiven, but he still continues to wallow in sin and so on. Praying like that, his name wants to change sunatullah which is impossible to happen. Allah's Word: Then you will not find changes to Allah's provisions, and you will not (also) find deviations from Allah's provisions. (Fathir\/35: 43) Praying before other than Allah or by using an intermediary (washilah) of a dead person is beyond the limits of what is highly reprehensible. Prayer is only presented to Allah, it should not deviate to others. Allah said: Say (Muhammad), \"Call those whom you consider (gods) other than Allah, they have no power to remove danger from you and are not (also) able to change it.\" Those whom they call, they themselves seek a way to God which of them is closer (to Allah). They hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is something to be feared.\" (al-Isra'\/17: 56-57) Hadith of the Prophet PBUH: Narrated from Abu Hurairah he said, \"The Messenger of Allah said, \"Ask Allah to wash it for me. They asked: O Messenger of Allah, what is washilah? The Messenger of Allah replied: \"Close to Allah azza Wa Jalla, then the Messenger of Allah recited the verse; (they themselves) seek a way to their Lord, which of them is closer to Allah.\" (Narrated at-Tirmidhi from Ibn Mardawaih)"

The prohibition of making damage covers all areas, such as damaging the association, physical and spiritual of other people, life and sources of livelihood (agriculture, trade, etc.), damaging the environment and so on. This earth has been created by Allah with all its features, such as mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, land, forests and others, all of which are intended for human needs, so that they can be processed and utilized as well as possible for their welfare. Therefore, humans are prohibited from making damage on earth. In addition, Allah also sent down religion and sent messengers to give instructions so that humans can live in happiness, security and peace. As the end of his prophethood, Allah sent Rasulullah SAW who brought Islamic teachings as a mercy to the universe. If people follow Islamic teachings correctly, then everything will be good, people will be good, the nation will be good, and the country will be good too. After Allah forbids humans from causing damage, then at the end of this verse it is revealed again about the ethics of praying. When praying for worldly or ukhrawi affairs, apart from wholeheartedly, solemnly and with a soft voice, it should also be accompanied by feelings of fear and hope. This way of praying will strengthen your faith and will keep you away from despair, because you directly ask Allah, the Almighty and the Most Rich. God's grace will pour out on those who do good, and praying is a good deed. Therefore, God's grace is certainly near and will pour out on him. There are many suggestions for doing good in the Qur'an, such as doing good to neighbors, to fellow human beings, to friends, to the environment and others. Therefore, if someone is going to slaughter an animal, he should do it in a good way, namely with a sharp knife so as not to cause suffering to the animal."

			"tafsir": "With these two verses, Allah confirms that one of the great gifts bestowed on His servant is to move the wind as a sign for the arrival of His grace, namely the wind that carries thick clouds which it drives to a dry land whose crops have been damaged due to lack of water, its wells are dry due to there is no rain and the inhabitants suffer from thirst and hunger. Then He sent down heavy rain on that land so that the land that was almost dead became fertile again and its wells were filled with water, so that its inhabitants lived in full sufficiency from the abundant yields of these plants. Regarding the role of rain in \"vivifying\" the \"dead\" land mentioned in the Qur'an, it has been analyzed by scientific experts because rain, apart from carrying water droplets, a material that is essential for the life of all living things in the world, it turns out that raindrops Rainwater also carries with it material that functions as fertilizer. As the sea water evaporates and reaches the clouds, it contains something that can revitalize dead land. Raindrops containing revitalizing ingredients are commonly known as \"surface tension droplets\". These materials are obtained from the surface layer of the sea which also evaporates. In this thin layer with a thickness of less than one-tenth of a millimeter and commonly called \"micro layer\" by biologists, a lot of organic litter is found that originates from the decomposition of micro-algae and zooplankton. Some of this litter collects and absorbs elements, such as phosphorus, magnesium and potassium, which are rarely found in seawater. This litter also absorbs heavy metals such as copper, zinc, cobalt and lead. Plants on land will obtain most of the mineral salts and other elements needed for their growth along with the arrival of rainwater. The salts that fall with rainwater are a miniature of fertilizers commonly used in agriculture (sodium, potassium, potassium and so on). Heavy metals in the air will form elements that will increase productivity during plant growth and fruiting. Thus, rain is a very important source of fertilizer. With the fertilizer contained in raindrops alone, within 100 years, nutrient-poor soil can collect all the elements needed for plant growth. Forests also grow and obtain their necessities of life from all the chemicals that come from the sea. In this way, every year about 150 tons of fertilizer fall to the earth. Without this mechanism, it is possible that the number of plant species will not be as many as we know today and the possibility of ecological imbalance may also occur. It is true that not all countries receive this abundance of grace, but there are also several places on earth where it does not receive a lot of rain. Concerning the lands where it does not rain, Allah says: Do you not see that Allah causes the clouds to move slowly, then collects them, then He makes them pile up, then you see the rain coming out of its gaps and He (also) sends down (drops) grains of) ice from the sky, (that is) from (clumps of clouds like) mountains, then He overwhelms (the grains of ice) to whom He wills and turns away from whom He wills. The flash of lightning almost blinded the sight. (an-Nur\/24: 43) According to this verse, heavy rain accompanied by hail does not pour into all corners of the earth, only Allah determines where the rain will fall and where the thick clouds just pass so that the area remained barren and dry."

If the dry and dead land can be brought back to life by Allah by raining down on it while the soil is perishable and there is no longer any element of life in it, surely Allah can also revive those who have died even though all that remains are only bones or have all become soil. About bringing those who have died back to life Allah says: And he made a parable for Us and forgot the origin of what happened; he said, \"Who can give life to the bones, which are shattered?\" Say (Muhammad), \"The one who will bring it to life is (Allah) who created it first. And He is All-Knowing of all creatures. (Yasin\/36: 78-79) Furthermore, Allah also gives a parable with good and fertile land and bad land and infertile to explain human nature and character in accepting and placing Allah's guidance. People who are good in nature and character, can accept the truth and use it for their own benefit and for the benefit of society. People who are bad in nature and character do not want to accept the truth in fact, always denying it so that he does not get the slightest advantage for himself from the truth let alone for his people.Ibn 'Abbas said: This verse is a parable given by Allah to believers and unbelievers, to good people and bad people.God likens people it with good and bad land, and Allah compared the revelation of the Qur'an with sleep it's raining. So the good earth when it rains can produce flowers and fruits, while the bad soil, when it is rained on, cannot grow except very little. Likewise, a soul that is good and clean from diseases of ignorance and moral decline, when illuminated by the light of the Qur'an becomes a soul that is obedient and obedient and has noble character. As for souls that are evil and dirty when exposed to the Qur'an, they rarely become good and virtuous. The Messenger of Allah said: \"The parable of knowledge and guidance that I was sent to convey is like a heavy rain that falls on the earth. Then there is some of the land that is clean (fertile) and can receive the rain, then grows lots of plants and grass. But there are Also among them is dry (hard) soil which does not absorb rainwater and does not grow anything. That land can hold water (collect it) so Allah made humans benefit from that water, they can drink, irrigate plants. There is also some land flat land cannot hold water nor does it grow plants. So those different lands are a parable for a person who can understand Allah's religion. Then he benefits from these instructions and teaches them to people, and a parable is also for people people who don't care about it and don't want to accept the hint.\" (History of Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Muslim and an-Nasai) The Prophet Muhammad gave the title (nickname) al-Hadi and al-Muhtadi to the first group who benefited themselves and benefited others, and gave the title al-Jahid to the third group who do not benefit themselves and cannot benefit others. But the Prophet Muhammad did not comment on the second group, namely people who cannot benefit others, because people from this group are of many kinds, among them there are hypocrites and including people who do not practice their religion. even though he knows and broadcasts the teachings of Allah to others. Thus Allah gives a parable with His favors and gifts so that those who feel the favors will be grateful."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah tells about the story of Noah and his apostleship. In the period between Prophet Adam and Prophet Noah the world began to build its civilization. Early humans still worshiped Allah according to the religion brought by the Prophet Adam. But over time, because of their busy worldly life, they began to distance themselves from religion, so that their religious enthusiasm began to decline. The teachings of monotheism that blossomed in their hearts began to fade. The statues of their leaders, which were originally made to honor and commemorate their services, they made to be worshiped or allies of Allah, because according to their understanding, these statues could draw them closer to Allah. In the end they forget Allah, and see that the statues are gods whose goodness is expected, and begged for grace and are afraid of the torment. After people's trust in Allah faded at that time, Allah did not allow them to continue in error. Therefore, Allah sent Prophet Noah to his people. The story of Noah's apostleship is addressed to the Arabs in Mecca and its surroundings who denied the Prophet Muhammad's apostleship. Their knowledge of the history of the apostles and people in the past was very limited because they only heard from the Jews and Christians around them. Allah in this verse assures them that in fact Allah has sent Prophet Noah to his people to warn them of Allah's wrath due to their disbelief. After Noah was sent as an Apostle he called on his disbelieving people to leave idols and worship God Almighty and the Creator of all things. He is the true God. Humans are obliged to worship Him with humility and humility. Prophet Noah conveyed to his people about his fears that they would get severe torment on the Day of Judgment if they did not heed his call. Some of the commentators view that the day of vengeance referred to in this verse is the day when the typhoon occurs. Furthermore, the concern expressed by Prophet Noah to his people showed that Prophet Noah had given up after carrying out his da'wah for quite a long time, but there was no response from his people, as is known from the following verses: He (Nuh) said, \"O my Lord , indeed I have called my people day and night, but my call did not increase their (faith), instead they fled (from the truth).

In the reality of human life, there are differences between each human being, both physical and spiritual differences.

Therefore, the Prophet Hud advised them to fear Allah and leave everything that He was angry with in order to avoid His torment. At other times and opportunities, he ordered his people to use their minds. Allah's Word: And to the people of 'Ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said, \"O my people!

According to Ibn Ishak, that al-Kalby said: the people of 'Ad were idol worshipers as well as the people of Prophet Noah who carved those who were considered sacred after death. Then the statues were considered as God. The 'Ad also made statues, they named Thamud and others they named al-Hatar. They live in Yemen in the Ahqaf area between Oman and Hadramaut. They are people who do damage on this earth because they are proud of the physical strength that is not owned by other people. Because they treat the inhabitants of this earth as they wish unjustly, Allah sent Prophet Hud from among them because it was Allah's decree that the messengers sent were taken from their own people who understand more about their people and are more acceptable to their calls because they know their personalities. However, when the Prophet Hud conveyed his treatise, namely calling on his people to worship Allah, the Almighty God and abandoning unjust acts, they denied Prophet Hud's call and instead they opposed it, as explained in the word of Allah, namely: So as for the people of 'Ad, they were arrogant on earth without (paying heed to) the truth and they say, \"Who is more powerful than us?\" Do they not see that it is Allah who created them.

Thamud is the name of a tribe of Arabs who have been exterminated known as \"Ba'idah Arabs\" who inhabit Hijir, namely the 'Ula area to the north of Medina, Saudi Arabia. Thamud is the name of their ancestor, namely the son of 'Atsir bin Iram bin Sam bin Nuh. The appearance of the Thamud was after the people of 'Ad were destroyed by Allah. According to a history, when the Prophet was in the Tabuk war in 9 Hijri, he passed through the area of the Thamud heritage. The Messenger of Allah forbade the companions from entering the area with his words, namely: \"Do not enter the places of those who are afflicted by Allah's punishment unless you are crying. If you do not cry, do not enter that place so that you are not struck by a disaster like the disaster that has befallen you.\" they.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Thus the Prophet's advice to friends to avoid places that have been hit by disasters. Saleh as is a Prophet sent by Allah to the Thamud. He comes from the Thamud people who are the best in his lineage, his position and the circumstances of his household as well as his morals. His prophetic miracle was the \"camel of Allah\". Prophet Saleh carried out his duties by conveying the commands of his Lord addressed to his people. Prophet Saleh called on them to worship Allah, the Almighty God, by emphasizing that there is no God but Allah, so they should fear Him. Prophet Saleh invited them to accept his call and not to follow those who drifted into polytheism, which led them to hell, as a result of their abandoning the teachings of the true religion. Prophet Saleh told his people that the proof of the truth of his prophethood was a camel which he called the \"Camel of Allah\", which Allah created not according to custom. According to some commentators, this camel came out of the big rock at the request of the Thamud as a miracle that they must pay attention to. Allah gave a miracle to Prophet Saleh in the form of a camel as proof of his apostleship, because the Thamud asked for proof of his apostleship. Prophet Saleh asked his people to let the camels eat whatever was in Allah's earth, because this earth belongs to Allah and these camels are Allah's camels and it is not natural for them to hinder the camel, let alone hurt it and slaughter it. Prophet Saleh threatened them that they would receive a painful punishment from Allah if they disturbed or killed the camel. In order not to cause trouble between them and the camels, they arranged drinking days to the lake for them and for the camels, because of the small supply of water, as the word of Allah says: And tell them that the water is divided among them That); everyone has the right to have a turn drinking.

The people of the Prophet Lut were the first to commit sodomy (homosexuality), so they received sins similar to the sins of those who imitated them, as explained in the hadith: \"A person who makes a bad habit in Islam, then the bad habit is done afterward, then he will bear the same as the sins of those who do that bad habit.\" (Muslim history) Another hadith explains: \"The person who invites to the right path, he gets the same reward as the reward given to his followers and it does not reduce their reward in the least, and the person who invites to do evil then he gets sin as much as the sins of his followers and it does not lessen in the least from their sins.\" (Muslim History) Allah created men and women with the aim of developing human offspring to prosper this world. Each type has a lust that encourages the realization of the need for the meeting of these two types of humans as a means to breed humans. The woman in her occurring form is beautiful, delicate and attractive. Between men and women there is mutual attraction like a pull between positive and negative. If humans are like that, how strange it is if there are groups of people who deviate from God's provisions. What a great violation of humanity that a man commits by having intercourse with another man with the aim of not developing offspring. If killing each other is considered as something bad, then the actions of Prophet Lut's people can be said to be even worse and can reduce the degree of humans and humanity so that they are lower than animals. This is because male animals have nothing to do with males as did the people of Prophet Lut. Allah's decree regarding this matter, is men for women and women for men. The people of Lut not only disavow God and are ungrateful for His blessings, but also engage in homosexuality, which in turn encourages women to become lesbians (connecting with each other). Allah sent Prophet Lut to people like this to convey Allah's teachings so that they return to the right path and leave bad behavior and are contrary to sunatullah. Because they rejected Lut's call, God destroyed the people. Prophet Lut was the son of Haran bin Tarikh. Tarikh is the brother of Prophet Abraham.

For example, animals that crawl and fly begin their lives with females and males to build nests together in trees. Meanwhile, homosexual behavior does not have such a purpose other than just giving vent to lust. Prophet Lut excitedly cursed and ridiculed their behavior. At the end of this verse it is stated that the Prophet Lut always ended his words with the words, \"But O my people, you are truly a group that transgresses, because you leave common sense and deviate from human nature, so you don't think about the bad consequences of your behavior. your behavior, namely severing offspring, destroying health and violating civilization.\" If Lut's people do not deviate from fitrah, always think healthy and have noble morals, they will certainly stay away from this heinous and accursed act. Criticism of the actions of the people of Prophet Lut was repeatedly expressed in various expressions, such as the following word of Allah: Why do you go to men to (fulfill) lust (you), not (to) women? Indeed, you are a people who do not know (the result of your actions). (an-Naml \/ 27: 55) Also the word of Allah in another verse, namely: Is it appropriate for you to go to men, robbery and do evil in your meeting places?\" (al-'Ankabut \/ 29: 29)"

However, they still reject the truth. Some of their leaders issued orders that the Prophet Lut and those who believed in him were expelled from their hometowns on the grounds that the Prophet Lut and those who believed were clean people and did not deserve to associate with them, because they were broken and dirty people. Therefore, it is better for Prophet Lut and his followers not to be in the same village as them, because between them and Prophet Lut there are differences in manners. They carried out the abominable act with pride, while the Prophet Lut and his believers were the ones who cleansed themselves from this accursed act. While mocking, they wanted the Prophet Lut and his followers to be expelled, so they could still act freely without anyone disturbing them. How low the morals of Lut's people are, without shame they are proud to commit immoral acts in the form of curses while insulting people of noble character. Only humans who do not believe in Allah and the Hereafter can fall into this lowly dignity."

Verily we are the messengers of your Lord, they are not will be able to disturb you, so go with your family at the end of the night and none of you will look back, except your wife.

(al-hijr\/15: 74) Allah's Word: So when Our decision came, We overturned the land of the people of Lut, and We showered them with stones from burning ground. (Hud\/11: 82) There is not even one commentator who can explain the ways in which the stones were collected from the earth being lifted up or layers of the earth being lifted above them, then falling down like rain. Likewise, the shape of the rock is whether it comes from hard soil alone or is it mixed with elements of a combustible substance or stones that come from star fragments. In this verse Allah shows His power to Muhammad and his people to take lessons from the events and behavior of people who deny Allah and His messengers. If Allah willed their destruction, this could happen by natural causes, for example; earthquakes, plague, wars and victims of slander and it can also be with extraordinary causes such as the typhoon that drowned Noah's people, the wind that knocked the Hud's people down, the lightning that destroyed the Saleh's and the rain of stones that destroyed the Lut's people. Regarding the homosexual act committed by Lut's people, there is a dispute between Fiqh scholars about the punishment as follows: 1. Imam Abu Hanifah believes that the perpetrator was dropped from a high place accompanied by throwing stones. But according to one history the perpetrators were only ta'zir given punishment to deter both muhsan and not muhsan. 2. Imam Malik saw that the culprit was stoned (whether the muhsan was ever married or not). The same goes for your partner if you are an adult. But according to one history, those who are not muhsan are subject to ta'zir laws. 3. Imam Syafi'i explained that the culprit was stoned whether muhsan or not. According to a history the culprit was stoned if he muhsan. If not, Muhsan was beaten a hundred times. 4. Imam Ahmad saw that the two perpetrators were killed. 5. In the opinion of some of the Prophet's companions, such as Abu Bakr, Ali, Ibn Zubair, the perpetrators were burned."

Their morals are so bad that their lives are mired in deceit, even to the point of exchanging, weighing. According to a history, when foreigners came to visit, they agreed to accuse that the money brought by foreigners was counterfeit, so they exchanged it at a very low price (exchange rate). To these people Allah sent the Prophet Shu'aib so that he would show them the right path and leave behind cheating in measures and weights. As usual, Allah strengthens the prophethood of each of His Prophets with miracles, as is known from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, namely: \"There was not a single Prophet from among the prophets unless he was given signs of his prophethood that made people believe in him. In fact, what was given to me was revelation that was conveyed to me, namely (the Qur'an). So I hope that I will have more followers than the followers of the prophets on the Day of Judgment.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) There is not a single verse in the Qur'an that explains the miracles given to the Prophet Shu'aib. Fakhrur Razi in his commentary, quoting az-Zamakhsyari in his commentary \"Al-Kasysyaf\" said that among the miracles of the Prophet Shu'aib, namely he gave his stick to Prophet Musa. The stick destroyed the large snakes of Pharaoh's sorcerers. Also he said to the Prophet Musa, that these goats will give birth all black and white hair, then it turned out to be true as he said it."

In other words, they told the Prophet Shuaib and his followers to choose whether they would remain in the new religion and continue preaching but be expelled from their land, or would they be willing to return to the religion of their ancestors and become members of society from their polytheistic people. It should be noted that the words \"return to the religion of the ancestors\" give the impression, as if the Prophet Shuaib had once been a follower of the religion of his people, and of course had also worshiped the gods they worshiped. This is not true, because Allah's prophets and messengers have always avoided major sins, including sins caused by polytheism of Allah. At the end of the verse it is explained that the Prophet Shuaib answered their challenge by asking the question whether they would still force him and his followers to return to their religion or would they expel him and his followers from Madyan if he refused the suggestion. Prophet Shuaib emphasized to his people that he and his followers were not afraid of being expelled from their country, and they would remain in the religion of Allah and continue their da'wah. Prophet Shuaib's love for Allah's religion is higher than love for a homeland whose inhabitants deny Allah. He and his followers prioritize living in the good pleasure of Allah, so that they can truly gain happiness in this world and the hereafter. Religion and faith are matters of the heart that cannot be forced in any way. He and his followers hate polytheism, because polytheism is a major sin that is not forgiven by Allah. An apostle who carries the mandate of spreading Allah's religion does not mind leaving the land of his homeland, if the situation and circumstances in that place do not allow him to carry out the task. As is known, the Prophet Abraham had carried out the migration, leaving his homeland, namely the city of Ur in the Chaldeans, in order to uphold the religion of Allah. Likewise the Prophet Muhammad had migrated from Mecca to Medina because of his love for Allah's religion beyond love for the motherland and others. Those who are reluctant to emigrate for the sake of Allah will be displeased by Allah, as Allah says: \"Indeed, those whose souls were taken by angels in a state of wrongdoing themselves, they (the angels) asked: \"How are you?\" They replied: \"We people who are oppressed in the earth (Mecca)\". They (the angels) asked: \"Isn't Allah's earth wide, so that you can emigrate (move) in the earth?\" So those people are in the hell of Hell, and (Jahanam) is the worst place to return to, except for those who are oppressed, whether men or women and children who are helpless and do not know the way (to migrate), then they are, hopefully Allah will forgive them. Allah is Most Forgiving , Merciful\". (an-Nisa\/4: 97-99)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the words of the Prophet Shuaib to his people who had threatened to expel them from their country if he did not want to stop his preaching. The Prophet Shuaib said: \"How great is our sin and lie against Allah, if we return to your religion, even though Allah has saved us and has guided us to the straight path. If someone follows your teachings without knowledge, it is considered as someone who lies to Allah, then what about a person who deliberately lies to Him, and deliberately deviates from the path that He has shown consciously, even though he has knowledge of it. Such disbelief is a very heinous act, it will not be forgiven. Therefore that we won't do.\" From this affirmation of Prophet Shuaib it can be concluded that Allah has saved his followers and his companions, including himself, from the shirk religion that his people adhere to, or it can also be interpreted that Allah has saved Prophet Shuaib from polytheism. He never adhered to the beliefs held by his people and did not worship anything that was worshiped by them. So Allah has pointed him to the right path. This is the same as what happened to the Prophet Muhammad as confirmed by Allah in His word: \"And He found you as a confused person, then He gave guidance\". (ad-dhuha\/93: 7) His other words: \"And thus We revealed to you (Muhammad) the spirit (Al-Qur'an) by Our command. Previously you did not know whether the Book (Al-Qur'an) and what faith is, but We make the Qur'an a light, with it We guide whom We want among Our servants. And indeed, you really guide (people) to the straight path \". (asy-Shura\/42: 52) Furthermore, Prophet Shuaib emphasized to his people, that it is not appropriate and unreasonable, if he and his followers will leave the true religion and return to their religion, unless Allah wills it. The point is that the Prophet Shuaib and his followers believed that the religion that their people adhered to was an untrue religion, while the religion that he and his followers adhered to was a true religion that could guarantee the safety and happiness of people in this world and the hereafter. Allah did not want the Prophet Shuaib and his followers to return to the religion of his people which was full of polytheism, because Allah Himself had freed him from polytheism and pointed him to the true religion. Therefore the Prophet Shuaib and his followers will not return to their religion. Then Prophet Shuaib reminded that Allah's knowledge is vast, covering everything. He knows all the wisdom and things that will bring trouble to His servant. His will always applies according to that wisdom. So everything that happens to His creatures is inseparable from this wisdom. Therefore, he and his followers put their trust in Allah alone and surrendered, and accompanied by obedience in carrying out what Allah had commanded them, namely maintaining His Shari'a and religion. It is he who will protect the Prophet Shuaib and his followers from all threats and disturbances from his people and from all dangers where the Prophet Shuaib has no power to avoid and fight them. It should be noted that one of the conditions for trustworthiness is persistence in carrying out the Shari'a that has been established by Allah, and complying with the general rules that He has established, both regarding nature and society, especially the relationship between cause and effect. For example, if we want to obtain sustenance from Allah, then we must try, and keep Allah's rules in carrying out these efforts. If the business has been carried out according to the necessary methods, and in keeping with the rules that have been set by Allah and His Shari'a, then we put our trust. Trust that is done without being preceded by the right effort and in accordance with God's rules is a wrong trust. That is why the Messenger of Allah once rebuked a person who did not tether his camel when he wanted to face the Prophet, because he said he had put his trust in Allah first. He should have tethered his camel first before he left it. This is an attempt to surrender. Under normal circumstances, a camel will not run away if it is properly tethered. The Prophet said: \"Moor then put your trust (in Allah)\". (History at-Tirmidhi) After the Prophet Shuaib declared his surrender to Allah swt, then ended with, may Allah give a fair decision between him and his people, then he expressed his confession and belief that Allah swt is the best decision maker, because He Most Just and All-Knowing. As is known, before the birth of the Prophet Shuaib in Madyan, many apostles were sent by Allah to convey His religion to mankind. In general, the apostles were challenged and despised by some of their people, who denied God. In the end, the apostles received help from God because they were people who carried out God's commands and were always honest and did good. On the other hand, it is the disbelievers who meet with bad luck due to their disbelief."

You will lose glory and honor, because by following Syuaib you will think that your ancestors you are people who are astray and will be punished by Allah. Apart from that, you will also lose your property and multiple profits in trade because the Shuaib religion does not allow fraud in buying and selling, especially regarding measurements and weights. Prophet Shuaib's people were clearly arrogant and kufr.This arrogant attitude arose because they ruled in ne Geri, it was this trait that prompted them to issue threats to Prophet Shuaib and his followers to expel them from Madyan.

Therefore, Allah has inflicted on them a severe punishment in the form of a terrible earthquake and lightning that destroys them, so that they die lying beneath the ruins of their houses, as if they had never been in that country. This story of the Prophet Shuaib, apart from being found in surah al-Araf, is also found in surahh Hud\/11: 85-95). However, there is a difference in mentioning the name of the punishment inflicted on those who disbelieve. In surahh al-Araf verse 91 it is stated that the doom will be in the form of \"ar rajfah\", which is a terrible earthquake. Whereas in surahh Hud verse 94 it is stated that the doom is in the form of \"Ash shaihatu\", namely a loud thundering sound. But the two verses are not contradictory, because these two types of doom can occur in a series and cause the same result, a loud sound of lightning and an earthquake have destroyed them, so they die lying under the rubble of their houses. The story of the Prophet Shuaib is also found in surah ash-Syuara, where it is stated that the Prophet Shuaib was sent by Allah to the inhabitants of the land of Aikah (asy-Syuara\/26: 176). Whereas in surahh al-Araf it is stated that the Prophet Shuaib was a compatriot of the Madyan people, namely the inhabitants of the country of Madyan. According to Ishak Ibn Basyar's statement quoted from Ibn Asakir, said that Ibn Abbas had given the following explanation: \"The inhabitants of Aikah are people who inhabit the swamp area which is located between the coast of the Red Sea and the land of Madyan\". From this information it can be understood that the Prophet Shuaib was sent by Allah to his people who had a relationship with them, all the way to the Red Sea. The two peoples have something in common, both regarding their disbelief, as well as regarding the various immoral acts they have committed, for example their dishonesty in weighing and measuring when buying and selling. Prophet Shuaib broadcast religion to all of them. The punishment of Allah has befallen both groups at the same time, or at a short distance, so the punishment that is inflicted on the people of Madyan is in the form of \"Ar rajfah\", which is a very powerful earthquake accompanied by a very loud roar, while the punishment that is inflicted on to the people of Aikah is the form of a samum wind and very hot air, which ends with the arrival of a cloud. They then gathered under the cloud that overshadowed them to get cool air, because they thought the cloud would rain down, but the cloud turned out to be a hot cloud that would fall on them so that all of them died when the hot cloud hit them. Some commentators argue that the punishment inflicted on both groups is the same. (This will be explained further when interpreting surah ash-Syuara)"

Allah emphasized that the consequences that would be suffered by those who had threatened to expel the Prophet Shuaib from Midian, were precisely those who were destroyed and disappeared, so that it was as if they had never lived and inhabited this country. Likewise, those who belied the Prophet Shuaib and said that those who follow their religion will definitely lose money, they are the ones who really lose money, while those who believe and follow the religion brought by Prophet Shuaib will be safe and earn the pleasure of Allah. From this verse a very valuable lesson can be drawn, namely that people who really want to stay in their country with a happy life and act arbitrarily against those who hold to the truth, will undoubtedly meet the result that is contrary to their expectations, namely destruction. .

A person will only understand the pleasures of health if one day he is sick. The same goes for other blessings that God has bestowed on humans.

This prosperity and adequacy of material possessions allowed them to develop offspring. Sufficient property and many offspring, is the peak of enjoyment for humans. Those who believe, if they receive favors from Allah, whether in the form of property or offspring, their faith and gratitude will increase, and they will do more good deeds. However, people who are weak in faith, when they get a lot of prosperity and enjoyment, they forget Allah Who gives these blessings, and a sense of pride and arrogance arises. They said: \"Our ancestors used to experience pleasure and pain, and so have we. The troubles we have experienced, and the happiness we feel now are the same as what our ancestors experienced. The troubles that befell us are not the result of the sins that we have committed, and the happiness that we get is not the result of the good that we do. This confession and attitude is clearly a tyranny that can occur throughout the ages. Thus, wealth and happiness have made them forget the relationship between cause and effect, and causes them to forget Allah's power, justice and mercy. This is because they do not understand the Sunnah of Allah that applies in this world; they do not understand the factors that cause happiness and misery on this earth. Even though Allah has provided guidance with the word Him: \"Surely Allah will not change the condition of a people before m they change the condition of themselves.\" (ar-Rad \/ 13: 11) Therefore, their denial and arrogance, arise after obtaining prosperity. Allah inflicts on them a punishment that comes suddenly, while they are not aware of the coming punishment. They do not comply with the Sunnatullah that applies in public affairs, and their minds are unable to think about it. After all, they did not want to follow the instructions and advice and warnings of the apostles to them. In this connection Allah has said: \"So when they forgot the warning that had been given to them, We also opened all the doors (pleasures) for them. So that when they were happy with what had been given to them, We punished them suddenly, then they fell silent in despair.\" (al-Anam\/6: 44) The character of disbelievers is that when they get enjoyment and happiness, they are arrogant and arrogant, not grateful for God's blessings. On the other hand, when a disaster strikes them, they despair and lament, not thinking about the reasons within themselves that caused the disaster. Allah's Word: \"So when disaster strikes a man he calls to Us, then when We give Our favor to him he says, \"Indeed I was given this favor only because of my intelligence.\" Actually, it is a test, but most of them do not know.\" (az-Zumar\/39: 49) The pleasure that was obtained after the tribulation which was then followed by a miserable doom, was not only experienced by the people of the Prophet Shuaib, even the people of the previous prophets, namely the people of Prophet Noah, Prophet Hud, and Prophet pious. Prophet Hud had warned his people, namely the ad people, as follows: \"Remember when He made you caliphs after Noah's people, and He made you stronger in body and stature. So remember Allah's favors so that you will be lucky.\" (al-Araf\/7: 69) Furthermore, the pious Prophet also warned his people, the shamud of such a thing: \"And remember when He made you caliphs after the ad people, and placed you on earth. In a flat place you established palaces and on the hills you carve into houses. So remember the favors of Allah and do not make mischief in the earth \". (al-Araf\/7: 74) The generation that is alive today should really realize, so that they do not suffer the miserable fate that the previous peoples experienced, because of their denial and arrogance towards Allah. If today's people are blessed by Allah with a better fate, in the form of economic stability and social life, science and so on, let them not forget themselves and commit immorality on earth. Let all the blessings bestowed by Allah be grateful and utilized according to the way He pleases and kept away from all kinds of disobedience.

With His words, Allah confirms that people who have common sense and adhere to the nature that He has bestowed on humans and pay attention to historical events and incidents and pay attention to Allah's verses, will certainly not feel safe from the arrival of His punishment. However, those who deny this have truly lost the common sense and nature that Allah has bestowed upon them and do not even want to pay attention to historical events and the verses of Allah, so that they have truly become losers. They have lost their worries about the coming of Allah's punishment even though they always do disobedience and polytheism. For a believer, the right attitude is to believe in the forgiving and loving nature of Allah, however, he must always be afraid of His punishment which may come upon him unexpectedly, as a result of his actions. Therefore, they are always careful and avoid things that will cause the doom to come upon them. In the Koran the disbelievers are usually called \"the losers?\" So those who lose their sense of worry about Allah's punishment are the same as those who despair of Allah's forgiveness and mercy, these two characteristics are included in the characteristics of disbelievers, who are also called losers."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is emphasized that the people who inherit a land after the inhabitants of that country have disappeared due to Allah's punishment due to their disobedience to Him, understand and believe that Allah has the power to inflict this punishment upon them because of their sins if He wills. Allah also has the power to lock their consciences to death, so that they can no longer accept religious lessons and advice and do not want to believe. As mentioned in the previous section, Allah has sent several messengers to their people before the Prophet Shuaib was sent to his people. The previous peoples had been overwritten by Allah's punishment because of their sins and their disobedience to Allah. The punishment that befell them was so great, it destroyed them in such a way that it was as if they had never lived on this earth. After they disappeared, God brought new people to inhabit the land. The new people know the history of the former people, because their books and scriptures mention it. They know what the people are experiencing, which is a terrible doom. And they know the things that caused the doom to be brought upon them, namely because of the sins of their disobedience to Allah and His Messenger. They should be able to take lessons from historical events, be able to understand that Allah has the power to inflict a similar punishment upon them if they commit sins and disobedience like the former people. This verse is not only a warning to disbelievers, but also to Muslims. After knowing the reasons for the punishment inflicted on the earlier Messengers and after knowing the sunnatullah regarding sinful people, then we should distance ourselves from such mistakes, so that we are not afflicted with Allah's punishment which will cause us to lose everything ."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah tells the Prophet Muhammad that Allah told him some of the news about the countries that He destroyed because of the behavior of their inhabitants who were disobedient and committed disobedience. By knowing this story, the Prophet Muhammad would not feel sad to see the behavior, disobedience and arrogance of his people, because what he experienced had been experienced by the previous apostles. The pattern of behavior of disbelievers and polytheists is the same at all times, and the Sunnatullah that applies to them also does not change. The events that befell the countries mentioned happened in the past, centuries before the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, so neither he nor his followers knew about these events. So Allah revealed these events back to the Prophet Muhammad through the Koran so that they could be a lesson for his people. Furthermore, in this verse, Allah reveals that the apostles were sent to the previous ummah, bringing clear statements and evidence about the oneness of Allah, but they also did not want to believe in Allah and His religion. They remain in denial, and are always in polytheism and commit various disobediences. Some of them knew the truth brought by the apostles, but they still denied it. This denial has indeed become their character and character, while some of them are renegades because they are solely loyal to what they inherited from their ancestors, without thinking about it and researching it first. In another verse that is in line with this verse, Allah says: Then after (Noah), We sent messengers to their (each) people, the messengers came to them with clear information, but they did not want to believe because they used to deny it. Thus We seal the hearts of those who transgress. (Yunus\/10: 74) God's Word goes on to explain that God branded the hearts of unbelievers. The words \"stamp\" remind us of the manufacture of coins and other materials from metal. The item is shaped and carved while the metal is being heated, then once the metal cools and solidifies, it can no longer be shaped and engraved. Such is the parable of the consciences of disbelievers, who have been frozen and closed dead, so that they can no longer accept any lessons and advice presented to them. They do not want to accept the religion brought by the apostles, which calls for the belief in monotheism and worship of Allah alone, no matter how clear the information and evidence and reasons and arguments given to them are."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is emphasized that Allah found that most of the former peoples did not like to keep their promises, and most of them were wicked people. Regarding the \"promise\" referred to in this verse, there are several tafsirs of the scholars. Among them said that what is meant by the promise is the original nature given by Allah to every human being, namely the tendency that encourages humans to return to their Lord when they face difficulties; or thank Him when avoiding difficulties or obtaining the pleasures of life. However, they remain in denial and disobedience. On the other hand, the pleasures and ease of life do not encourage them to be grateful to Allah, they do not even acknowledge these blessings as gifts and mercy from Him. Another opinion says that what is meant by \"promise\" in the verse is the original nature or nature given by Allah to every human being, namely the tendency to believe in monotheism, faith in His oneness and only worship Him, and not associate Him with others. something too. But in reality, they have abandoned fitrah, and cast the belief in monotheism, even associating partners with Allah, regardless of the calls of the apostles and the statements and evidence put forward. They only follow the will of lust, as well as mere whispers of Satan, contrary to their holy nature. In a hadith narrated by Imam Muslim, it is stated that the Messenger of Allah said: Allah swt said: \"Verily, I have created My servants of monotheism; then the devil comes and turns them away from their original religion, and forbids to them what they have permitted for them.\" (Muslim history) In another hadith narrated by Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim, Rasulullah saw said: \"Every child is born in a fitrah, then it is his parents who make him a Jew, Christian or Zoroastrian\". (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Thus it is clear that if humans have deviated from the belief in monotheism, then this is due to outside influences, not the nature brought from their mother's womb, which Allah has bestowed on every human being. The characteristic of wickedness referred to in this verse is that a person commits various immoral acts repeatedly, regardless of religious advice and teachings as well as laws and threats. It should be noted that God's word in this verse says that most of them are wicked. This gives an understanding that the earlier people were not all wicked and abandoned the belief in monotheism which is a holy nature that Allah has bestowed upon every of His servants. Even some of them remained in their holy nature, so that the arrival of the apostles who brought the monotheistic religion was immediately welcomed by them, and they always kept away from all kinds of disobedience and polytheism. It was they who always accompanied the apostles in facing threats and disturbances from unbelievers, and it was they who were always saved by Allah and His Messenger from the doom and calamity that befell the wicked people."

			"tafsir": "The story of the Prophet Musa as in the Koran is mostly found in the Makiyah surahhs, both long and short surahhs, starting from surahh al-Araf which is the first Makiyah surahh according to the arrangement of the Al-Quran surahs, where there is the story of the Prophet Musa as . Then there are also surahh Thaha, Asy-Syuara, An-Naml, Al-Qashas, Yunus, Hud and Al-Muminun. The name of the Prophet Musa (as) is often mentioned in the Quran more than 130 times, no other Prophet or king has been mentioned that many times in the Quran. This is because, among other things, the story of the Prophet Musa is very similar to the story of the Prophet Muhammad. In addition, these two Prophets had a large number of people who had high power and civilization progress. Prophet Musa (as) was the son of Imran. He is an Israeli national, born in Egypt, when the Children of Israel settled in the land of Egypt, during the reign of the Pharaoh kings. In this verse, Allah narrates that after sending His messengers mentioned in the previous verses, He sent the Prophet Musa as carrying His verses to Pharaoh and his leaders. Pharaoh is a title used by kings in Egypt, in ancient times, as the title \"Kisra\" for Persian kings and the title \"Emperor\" for Roman kings. The pharaoh who ruled in Egypt during the time of Prophet Musa, was named Minepthah Ramses II. He was a ruler of the nineteenth dynasty, around 1491 BC. Mineptah's mummy (corpse) still exists today and is stored in the Egyptian National Museum, Cairo. It is mentioned in this verse, that Pharaoh and his leaders had disbelieved in the verses of Allah that were brought to them by the Prophet Musa. The verses or miracles that Musa brought to them, they still refused with arrogance and arrogance. Pharaoh and the leaders of his people had enslaved his people. Even more so for the Children of Israel who were foreigners living in Egypt at that time, under the grip of the unjust power of Pharaoh and his leaders. If Pharaoh and his leaders had believed in the Prophet Musa and the religion he brought, surely all the inhabitants of the land of Egypt at that time would have believed too, because they were all in the grip of the power of Pharaoh and his princes. Due to the denial of Pharaoh and his superiors, at the end of this verse Allah commands the Prophet Muhammad and his people to pay attention to the consequences of those who disobey His messengers and do damage to the earth, namely by committing injustice and enslaving fellow human beings. Allah will tell in the next verse how the Prophet Musa, as one of the oppressed Children of Israel, was finally able to defeat Pharaoh's sorcerers and convince his scholars of the truth of the message he brought. The Israelites are descendants of the Prophet Yaqub whose name is Israel. Prophet Yaqub came from Right (Palestine). He moved to Egypt with his family and sons after being invited by his son, the Prophet Yusuf, to move to Egypt. The Prophet Yusuf at that time was appointed by the King of Egypt to be the ruler who took care of the country's supplies. The descendants of the Prophet Yaqub then multiplied in Egypt, until they finally became a large nation called the Children of Israel. Pharaoh tried to prevent the Children of Israel from continuing to reproduce, by killing every son that was born and leaving his daughters alive. They were obliged to pay exorbitant taxes and were used as forced laborers and other forms of oppression and slavery. Therefore, Allah sent the Prophet Musa to free them from Pharaoh's slavery and bring them out of the land of Egypt. God's help to the Prophet Musa as next, is to inflict punishment on Pharaoh and save the people of Prophet Musa, as well as the drowning of Pharaoh and his followers and his army in the Red Sea when they chased Prophet Musa and his people. This story contains a very valuable lesson, that only material strength does not guarantee victory for a person or a nation. On the other hand, a people who have firm faith in Allah will surely receive help from Him, so that the people will be able to defeat those who only rely on material strength."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, the words of Moses are narrated, which were first conveyed to Pharaoh after Allah appointed him as an Apostle. Prophet Musa told Pharaoh that he was the messenger of Allah, the Lord of the worlds. This notice means that: Moses has carried out his duties as a prophet of Allah, the Creator and Sovereign of all the worlds. Therefore Pharaoh should accept the statement of the Prophet Musa and will not hinder his duties as an Apostle. Furthermore, the Prophet Musa added his statement, that he said the truth about Allah. Meaning: what he said that Allah is the Lord of the Worlds, and that He has sent him as a Messenger is the truth. He didn't say anything that wasn't true, because it's impossible for God to send someone who likes to lie. Then it was emphasized again, that Moses brought the evidence that God gave him, to prove the truth in his preaching. In that speech, the Prophet Musa used the expression: \"Verily, I have come to you with proof from your Lord.\" This was to show that Pharaoh was not God, but merely a servant of God. While the real God is Allah swt. This information is very important, because the arrogant Pharaoh had claimed to be God and ordered his people to worship him. So this affirmation of Prophet Musa has denied the lies and arrogance of Pharaoh, who had positioned himself as God. besides that, the expression of the Prophet Musa, also implies, that the evidence he brought was a gift from Allah, not from himself. At the end of this verse it is stated, that after presenting the statements mentioned above, and after going through a tiring struggle Musa as demanded from Pharaoh that he free the Children of Israel from the clutches of power and slavery, and let them go with Prophet Musa to leave Egypt, return to their homeland in Palestine, so that they are free and independent to worship their God and carry out his teachings. The demands of the Prophet Musa imply that slavery by humans against fellow human beings must be eliminated and a ruler should give freedom to people who are under his control, to embrace religion and perform worship according to their respective beliefs. Therefore, if Pharaoh did not want to believe in Allah, let him not prevent other people from believing and worshiping according to their beliefs. It is interesting to note that the first utterances of the Prophet Musa as in carrying out his duties as an Apostle were different from those of the previous Prophets and Apostles, when they started preaching, for example: a. The first utterance of Prophet Nuh as to his people was as follows: \"Indeed, We really have sent Noah to his people, then he said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! There is no god (worship) for you but Him\". Indeed, I am afraid that you will be punished by a terrible day (Doomsday). (al-Araf\/7:59) b. Prophet Hud's words to ad people were: \"And to ad people ( We sent Hud, their brother. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! There is no god (worship) for you besides Him. So why are you not fearful?\" (al-Araf\/7: 65) And Prophet Saleh's words to the Samud people were: \"And to the Samud (We sent) their brother Saleh. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! There is no god (worship) for you besides Him. Indeed, clear evidence has come to you from your Lord. This (a) she-camel from Allah is a sign for you. Let him eat in Allah's earth, don't get hurt, later you will get a painful punishment.\" (al-Araf\/7: 73) c. Prophet Shuaib's words to his people, the people of Madyan, are: \"And to the people of Madyan, (We sent) Shuaib, their own brother. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! There is no god (worship) for you besides Him. Indeed, clear evidence has come to you from your Lord. Perfect your measures and scales, and do not do any harm to you. Do not do mischief in the earth after (created) well. That is better for you if you are believers.\" (al-Araf \/ 7: 85) While the first words of the Prophet Musa addressed to Pharaoh were: \"O Pharaoh! Indeed, I am a messenger from the Lord of all the worlds.\" (al-Araf\/7: 104) When we compare these verses, one can see the difference between them, namely that: the first utterances of the Apostles before Prophet Musa were addressed to their people each of which contains an appeal to the religion of monotheism, namely worshiping Allah alone, on the grounds that there is no god for humans other than Allah. Meanwhile the first utterance of the Prophet Musa addressed to Pharaoh contains a notification to him that Musa is the messenger of Allah. In that statement there is no real appeal to Pharaoh to worship Allah. From here, the following conclusions or understanding can be drawn: a. The main object (target) of Musa's da'wah was not only Pharaoh but also his own people, namely the Children of Israel. Musa served to release the Children of Israel from Pharaoh's slavery and guide his people to the true religion b. Prophet Musa knew the character and behavior of Pharaoh, Pharaoh did not Even if he disavows God, he even considers himself a god and orders others to worship him. Therefore Pharaoh was only given a warning that the real god was not him, but God the Creator of the universe. Since it would be pointless to invite Pharaoh to worship Allah, this invitation would have been ignored and he would have ignored it."

It should be remembered that in commentary books which base their tafsir on traditions received from the ancients, there are often exaggerated and very strange stories about the snake that emerged from the staff of the Prophet Musa. We must be vigilant and careful in accepting such narrations, because they have no solid foundation. Some of them even originate from Israiliyat narrations, namely tales that came from Jews, who infiltrated Muslim circles with the aim of undermining Islam from within. Historical facts show that the slander and chaos that occurred among Muslims, even the killings of caliphs, were the culprits of these intruders, such as Abdullah Ibn Saba from the Jewish nation who pretended to convert to Islam. Then there was chaos in the fields of faith, politics and so on, in the early days of Islam. Thank God that among the Islamic scholars, there have been intellectuals who are vigilant, then conducted investigations into these narrations and preferred narrations that had a strong basis, whose truth was not in doubt."

Pharaoh was very worried that his people, the Egyptian nation would also follow in the footsteps of the magicians to believe in Musa as, because that would result in the collapse of his kingdom and power as god for his people who had been forced to worship him as god. Apart from that, he also tried to act as if he was defending the interests of his people, namely protecting their independence and protecting their religion. Therefore he said that the magicians had conspired with Moses to take control of Egypt from their own country. Such is generally the attitude of unjust and insolent rulers.

They exposed Pharaoh's crime against them, namely that Pharaoh wanted to take revenge on them by torturing them cruelly. And all of that is only because they have believed in God's verses when these verses came to them. Their words imply that Pharaoh will not influence them, because faith in Allah is something that is very valuable and in accordance with the original human nature, and is the subject of their happiness in this world and the hereafter. Pharaoh rebuked the magicians because they had bowed down and believed in Allah without asking Pharaoh's permission first. Besides, Pharaoh had accused them of conspiring with the Prophet Moses to wrest power from his hand, and to expel the Egyptians from their homeland. Finally Pharaoh threatened to cut off their hands and feet. coupled with the torment of crucifixion. All of that is in essence the wrath of Pharaoh against them. After that Pharaoh tried to take revenge with their actions and anyone who believed in Allah and fulfilled the call of Prophet Musa. Whatever efforts made by Pharaoh still did not bring results for him. On the contrary, Pharaoh and his officials will meet a very bad fate. In another verse, Allah's words to the Prophet Musa and Harun are mentioned as follows: \"You two and those who follow you will win.\" (al-Qasas\/28: 35) Furthermore, Allah tells about the magicians, that after they give a firm answer as above, they then pray to the presence of Allah, may they be given patience, and when Allah dies they should be in a state of submission to -His. Their prayer to Allah to be given patience shows how important patience is in every struggle, especially the struggle against tyranny. Patience does not only mean the ability to restrain themselves from anger, but also means self-awareness, control over passions, and resilience in the face of all obstacles and suffering. A patient person will not take revenge, even though he is able to do so. A person who is patient can always maintain sound reasoning, so that he will not fall into actions that can be detrimental to himself and the struggle of his people. The way to achieve patience is firm faith in Allah and the Hereafter. This has been proven by the historical reality of mankind, namely that people with strong faith are the most patient and tough people in struggle and have high courage. Because of this patience and courage, ideas and efforts arose among the leaders of the armed forces in several countries, to promote religious education and spiritual development for soldiers and officers of the armed forces, so that they have a strong faith that will produce the character of patience and courage. Meanwhile, Allah repeatedly in His word promises His help to those who are patient, and He gives instructions so that people are always patient and encourages others to be patient. Allah says: (That is) those who are patient and only in Allah they put their trust. (an-Nahl\/16: 42) His word again: Except for those who believe and do good and advise each other to truth, and advise patience. (al-Ashr\/103: 3) The teachings of patience are very important to the Islamic religion, so that in the Al-Quran there are about 100 times it is mentioned, both in the form of commands about being patient, as well as in the form of praise for those who are patient, or promises of victory, luck and Allah's help for those who are patient. And often the words of patience are coupled with words of faith, piety, trust, truth, struggle, willpower and so on. In the hadiths of the Prophet there are many teachings about patience. Regarding the relationship between patience and courage he said: \"A strong person is not someone who can slam people, but a strong person is someone who is able to control himself when he is angry\". (History of Imam al-Bukhari, from Abu Hurairah ra) A patient person is always calm and has a clear mind, so that all his words and actions can be controlled properly. His stance was not shaken by threats and inducements no matter what. Therefore, in another hadith Rasulullah saw said \"Patience is a bright light.\" (History of Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, and others) On the other hand, an impatient person will certainly lose his mind, and will be easily influenced by Satan, so that his words and actions cannot be controlled. This will lead to bad results and will result in losses and regrets. Therefore the Prophet warned with his words: \"The nature of haste is the devil's work.\" (History of at-Tirmidhi) Because of the importance of the nature of patience, it is not surprising why people who have believed in the Prophet Musa as in the story begged Allah to be abundantly patient, so that their faith would not be shaken by the threats of Pharaoh and his superiors. magnifying."

And leave you and your gods?\" This slander for the umpteenth time shows their fear of losing power, influence and property, because they have seen signs that the people have started to turn their backs on Pharaoh to Prophet Musa (as), after witnessing his miraculous victory. Especially after seeing the magicians kneeling to express their faith, and no longer caring about Pharaoh's threats against them. In launching this slander, these magnates used political and religious elements. They alleged that Moses would undermine Pharaoh's position as sole ruler in Egypt. In addition, the position of Pharaoh as a god so far will also disappear by itself. More than that, the gods that were worshiped by the Egyptians at that time would also be abandoned, for example the God \"Osiris\" who, according to them, had incarnated his spirit in a cow which they called \"Apis\", apart from that, they also worshiped \"all kinds of animals \". Likewise they worshiped the darkness, as well as the statue of Akron which they considered to be a fly repellent. In short, the Pharaoh's people at that time were in the height of error, because they worshiped the sun, moon and stars, as well as humans and animals, both large animals and the smallest insects. Pharaoh himself was an adherent of animal worship beliefs, then abandoned that belief, then he claimed to be a god and ordered his people to worship him. This was after he saw himself having such great power among his people. (This information is contained in the book Al-Milal wan-Nihal by ash-Syahrastany) The slander of the Pharaoh's officials had succeeded in hitting its target, namely influencing the Pharaoh who had lost his balance, thereby arousing his emotions and anger. Therefore, he replied: \"Okay, we will kill their sons, and let their daughters live, and we have full authority over them. That is to say, that in order to prevent the reign of the Prophet Musa in Egypt, Pharaoh would take various actions, including killing every male child born to the women of the Children of Israel, namely people of the same nationality as the Prophet Musa who lived in Egypt at that time. would be allowed to live so that Pharaoh and his superiors could use them as slaves.With this action Pharaoh hoped to stem the growth of Prophet Musa's power in Egypt, because he would still have more male power and greater power, while on the contrary, The Prophet Musa and the Children of Israel were generally increasingly lacking in male power, so they would not oppose Pharaoh's power, and free themselves from the chains of i slavery. This evil plan was actually implemented by Pharaoh and his officials, so that the Children of Israel who lived in Egypt at that time suffered greatly, physically and mentally."

Besides, every male child they gave birth to was killed by Pharaoh's agents. Therefore the Prophet Musa said to them: \"Ask Allah for help and be patient; verily this earth belongs to Allah, it is inherited to whom He wills among His servants, and a good outcome is for those who are pious.\" \". The Prophet Musa comforted and reassured his people by reminding them of the power of Allah, that He is the one who owns and controls the earth, and everything that happens on this earth is in accordance with His Sunnah, that is, every people who are unjust and unjust must meet destruction, and every people those who believe and are patient will certainly receive His help, thus obtaining victory and a good outcome. Therefore, they should seek help from Him, accompanied by patience, faith, unity and courage in defending truth and justice. In addition to raising hope about God's help and His mercy to free them from Pharaoh's cruelty and making the Children of Israel the rulers behind the day in the part of the earth that God has promised them, it also contains a very important warning for his people, namely if later they become rulers, do not act arbitrarily like Pharaoh and his princes, because Allah always watches over the actions and actions of each of His creatures, therefore, if they are in power and commit tyranny too, surely Allah will bring punishment to them. This verse contains a very valuable lesson about human behavior when they are facing this suffering, or before they receive God's grace, and when they receive this grace. A very despicable attitude is to complain and ask God for help when you are in trouble, and then deny or forget God's grace after getting it. The attitude that should be taken is to be patient and trustful and ask God for help when facing difficulties, and be grateful for God's grace after obtaining happiness. Grateful for God's grace, not only with words, but the most important thing is to carry it out with deeds. Therefore, if someone gains power, then his power is used to commit injustice or enrich himself at the expense of others, then this means that he is not grateful for the blessings of Allah that he has obtained, namely rank and power, and therefore it is fitting that Allah inflicts punishment on him. ."

Hearing this complaint, the Prophet Musa said, \"Hopefully Allah destroys your enemies and makes you caliphs on earth, then Allah will see how you do,\" meaning: even though what happens is but hope that Allah will destroy your enemies, and made you rule in that part of the earth that your Lord promised you should remain. In greeting his people, Prophet Musa used the expression \"hopefully.\" He uses this expression to not ensure that Allah's help and mercy will come to them. Because if he used a certain expression, maybe his people would ignore the obligations that they need to do to get Allah's help, because Allah's help to His servants is not given just like that, but depends on the efforts made by the people concerned, for example sincerity, discipline, unity, and so on."

In this way, God's promise was fulfilled, namely the domination of the Children of Israel in the eastern part which was fertile and full of blessings. This is a great gift to the Children of Israel. The favors that were bestowed were, according to Allah's decision and decree, because of the fortitude and patience of the Children of Israel in facing the cruelty and oppression of Pharaoh and his people. Allah has destroyed everything that Pharaoh built whose purpose was to boast and destroy Allah's religion, such as beautiful cities and palaces, great buildings for the Egyptians, beautiful parks and gardens, towers made Haman to see God and so on. Allah destroyed everything that was built by Pharaoh and his people, in order to: 1. Strengthen the prophethood of Musa as, and prove the truth that Musa had conveyed to Pharaoh and his people, such as the words, \"Allah will punish everyone who disobeys Him. Therefore Allah punished them by sending hurricanes, locusts, and so on to them, which brought havoc and destruction.\" 2. Freeing the Children of Israel from the slavery of Pharaoh and his people. 3. Destroy Pharaoh and his people, so that they no longer colonize other countries and their inhabitants. Before Pharaoh and his soldiers drowned in the Red Sea, they had been warned by Musa (as), but they ignored the warning. Their tyranny was increasing, they even intended to kill Musa (as) and those who believed with him. So Allah destroyed them because of their injustice, according to the word of Allah: Allah did not wrong them, but those who wronged themselves. (ali Imran\/3: 117) From this verse it is understood that firm faith in Musa as and Harun as and the revelation he received from Allah encouraged him to liberate the Children of Israel from the oppression of Pharaoh and his people, with great fortitude and patience Prophet Musa invited the Children Israel believes in Allah. He believes that his efforts include efforts to affirm Allah's religion and uphold the truth will receive Allah's help. After going through a very hard struggle and a long time, God gave help and victory with the destruction of Pharaoh and his people. This can be used as an example and parable by Muslims, that Allah's promise to believers is the same as Allah's promise that He promised to the Apostles before, when struggling to uphold Allah's religion, namely to help and defend every effort to uphold Allah's religion, and uphold Allah's religion. truth, as Allah says: O you who believe! If you help Allah (religion), He will help you and strengthen your position. (Muhammad\/47: 7) And Allah said again: \"And indeed, We have sent before you (Muhammad) several messengers to his people, they came to him with (sufficient) statements, then We avenged those who sinners. And it is Our right to help those who believe.\" (ar-Rum\/30: 47)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that with inayah (help) and Allah's power, the Children of Israel were saved across the Qulzum Sea (red sea) so that they were released from the oppression of Pharaoh and his people. From this verse it is understood that Moses and the Children of Israel easily crossed the Red Sea because of Allah's help, not because of other things such as because the sea water was receding and so on. This event was a miracle for Prophet Musa. In another verse it is explained that after the oppression of Pharaoh and his people against the Children of Israel reached its peak, Allah ordered Moses to leave one night to leave Egypt with the Children of Israel to escape from the oppression of Pharaoh. So Moses carried out all the commandments of God. After hearing the departure of Musa and his people, Pharaoh was angry, and in a short time his army was gathered and immediately chased Musa and the Children of Israel that very night. In the morning, when the sun began to shine, Pharaoh was able to catch up from behind, both sides had seen each other, while Musa and the Children of Israel were already on the seafront. They were faced with a difficult situation if they continued to run blocked by the sea. When they came back, the enemy's sword was already drawn. It was at that moment that God showed His power by ordering Moses to strike his staff into the sea. Musa struck it, the waters of the sea parted, and between the halves of the water there was a road stretching to the other side. So Musa and the Children of Israel quickly passed by, and from behind Pharaoh and his army continued to follow them. Finally, Musa and the Children of Israel safely reached the other side, while Pharaoh and his army who were trying to walk the path that Musa and his people were going through were ambushed by sea water which suddenly reunited, the road that stretched disappeared, so that Pharaoh and his people sank to the bottom of the sea. The events of the sinking of Pharaoh and his army are also explained by other verses. Allah said: \"And verily, We have revealed to Moses, \"Go with My servants (the Children of Israel) by night, and beat (make) for them a dry path in the sea, (you) do not need to fear overtaken and there is no need to worry (will drown).\" Then Pharaoh with his army chased them, but they were rolled over by the waves of the sea which drowned them.\" (Taha\/20: 77-78) The story of the sinking of Pharaoh and his army in the Qulzum Sea is also mentioned in the Old Testament, Book of Exodus XIV: 15-31. After Musa and the Children of Israel safely crossed the sea of Qulzum, namely the area around the Arab lands which is located at the tip of the Asian continent in the Southwest, they continued their journey. So they came to a land whose inhabitants worshiped idols. Seeing this situation, their memories returned to the customs and beliefs of their ancestors, which they used to do together with Pharaoh, such as worshiping other than Allah, whether in the form of animals, statues, stones, and so on. Because of that they spontaneously asked Prophet Musa, \"O Musa, make us an idol, as they have several gods ........\". From the request of the Children of Israel to Musa as, it was understood that even though Musa as had conveyed his message as best he could to the Children of Israel, the Children of Israel did not yet fully understand and live up to the monotheistic religion conveyed by Moses. The customs and beliefs of their ancestors, such as worshiping idols, still have a great influence on them, so that the belief in monotheism newly instilled by Musa can easily be shaken. It is known that the people of the Children of Israel at the time of the Pharaohs were of the lower class and lacked knowledge. Almost none of the scholars came from them, all scholars came from the native Egyptian population, descended from the nobility. Most of the Children of Israel at that time lived as ordinary people, manual laborers, and many even lived as slaves who were forced to build pyramids and tombs of kings. Because of their situation, apathy arose among them, there was no desire to free themselves from Pharaoh's slavery, there was no strong desire to be free. There was no firm attitude and strong ideals in them, this can be seen in their reactions, actions and attitudes in accepting Musa's invitation, the slightest obstacle and difficulty they faced, they spontaneously expressed their despair to Moses even stated that he preferred to live enslaved and oppress Pharaoh. The attitude of the Children of Israel towards Musa's invitation to live as an independent nation was no different from their attitude towards Musa's invitation to follow the true religion. Even though the Prophet Musa had explained the religion well and clearly, so that they understood and followed it, however, as soon as they saw statues, people who worshiped idols, people who worshiped gods and all kinds of polytheism, their memories returned to their previous beliefs. , therefore they spontaneously asked Moses, to make idols to worship them. They feel more secure in worshiping something that can be seen and touched, decorated and so on than worshiping something that is unseen, invisible to the eye and cannot be touched by the hand. In contrast to the magician who believed in Moses, after his magic skills were defeated by the miracles of Moses. They included people who had knowledge and intellectuals at that time. Because of that they can distinguish something that is wrong with what is right with their knowledge, so they can know which are the signs of Allah's power and which are not, which can be achieved by the five senses and which cannot be achieved, and so on. Therefore, after they believed in Allah and the Prophet Musa, they also believed with all their hearts, could not be swayed by any circumstances and by any threat, including Pharaoh's threat to them. Their faith already has a solid foundation, so that it is a strong belief as a result of knowledge, feelings, experience and what is in them. The Children of Israel, as explained above, were people who did not know the characteristics of God, did not know the necessity of worshiping only Allah alone by not associating Him with anything, did not know the obligation to worship directly addressed to Allah without taking intermediaries with anything. , such as statues, buildings, graves, or other objects that they make as intermediaries in worshiping God. They must believe that only Allah is One. This type of faith such as the faith of the Children of Israel which is caused by ignorance and the influence of the beliefs of the ancestors, is also found in humans in general, and Muslims in particular, and is also found in every period of history, from the time of the Prophet Muhammad to the present day, as which is implied by the hadith of the Prophet saw: Ahmad and An-Nasai narrated from Abi Waqid Al-Laitsy, he said: \"We left Medina with the Messenger of Allah to the Hunain war, so we passed a sidrah tree, I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, make it for us tree \"dhatu anwath\" (a tree that can be used as a hanger) as the heathen have \"dhatu anwath\". The Messenger of Allah replied: \"(God is Great). Your request is like the request of the Children of Israel to Moses: (Make us an idol, as they have worship), in fact you follow the beliefs of people before you.\" (History of Ahmad and an-Nasai) The fact that the existence of this belief is implied by the hadith above in the past and present should serve as a warning to Muslims to try their best to provide understanding and enlightenment, so that all Muslims have beliefs and beliefs in accordance with what is taught Islam. There are still many among the Muslims who still worship cemeteries, believing in the existence of supernatural powers in rocks, trees, caves, and so on. Therefore they worship and worship him with submission and solemnity, which sometimes exceeds submission and solemnity to Allah. There are also many among the Muslims who use washilah intermediaries in worship, as if they do not believe that Allah is very close to His servants and that worship addressed to Him will arrive without intermediaries. This kind of belief is no different from the shirk belief adopted by the Jahiliyah Arabs in the past, the only possibility that is different is the name. Such a belief is contrary to the verse: \"... and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.\" (Qaf\/50:16) And the confession of Ibrahim as mentioned in His word: \"I turn my face to (Allah) who created the heavens and the earth with full submission (following) the true religion, and I am not among those who are polytheists .\" (al-Anam\/6: 79) Even Allah confirms in His word again: \"And when My servants ask you (Muhammad) about Me, then indeed I am near. I grant the request of the one who prays when he prays to Him Me. Let them fulfill My (command) and believe in Me, so that they may obtain the truth.\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 186) People who worship a god beside Allah are people who make fools of themselves, as Allah says: And people who hate the religion of Abraham, are only people who make fools of themselves... (al-Baqarah\/2 : 130) The request of the Children of Israel was answered by the Prophet Musa: \"Surely you, Children of Israel, do not know the characteristics of Allah, what is obligatory for Him and what is impossible for Him. He is One and has no partner for Him. \"The religion that was brought by Allah's messengers from ancient times until now, namely the religion brought by the Prophet Muhammad, as the final prophet and messenger, is a religion that truly acknowledges the oneness of Allah, does not contain the slightest element of shirk in it. This is because worship or worship is a feeling that arises from the heart. This feeling creates submission in the heart and soul to the Supreme Being, growing the belief that he alone has the right to be worshipped; while the others are His creations that are equal in position to His other creations. Therefore, worshiping idols other than Allah will undermine monotheism that arises from the feelings that exist within a person, and shows one's dependence on worship, in addition to being dependent on Allah. Because of that the Prophet Musa refused firmly the request of his people."

			"tafsir": "This verse describes the events of the revelation of the Book of the Torah to the Prophet Musa. Allah has made His promise to the Prophet Musa that He will send down revelations to him which contain the main points of religion and the main points of law which are the guidelines for the Children of Israel in their efforts to achieve happiness in life in this world and in the hereafter. The time of the revelation that was promised was for thirty nights on Mount Sinai, then added another ten nights to make it forty nights. Regarding the revelation of the Book of the Torah to the Prophet Musa narrated by Ibnul Mundzir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn Abbas, when interpreting this verse, that Musa said to his people, \"Indeed, my Lord (Allah) promised me thirty nights. I will meet Him and I will make Aaron to take care of you.\" So after Musa arrived at the promised place, namely in the month of Â¨ulkaidah and ten nights of the month Â¨ulhijjah, then Moses stayed and waited on Mount Sinai for forty nights, and Allah revealed to him the Torah in the form of inscribed pieces, Allah brought Moses closer to Him to talk to. After that God spoke, and Moses heard the vibration of a pen. From these two narrations it can be concluded that Musa as went to Mount Sinai alone, no one accompanied him, in the sense that he separated himself from his people, the Children of Israel. After Musa died, the Israelites were influenced by Samiri's invitation, so they joined in worshiping the calf statue. Before Musa as departed for the place appointed by Allah to receive the Torah, he handed over the leadership of his people to his brother Harun as, and declared Aaron as his representative, taking care of the interests of the Children of Israel while he was away, Musa warned Harun not to follow the wishes and opinions of people who misguided and loves to do damage. Harun was the elder brother of Musa (as) and was appointed by Allah as a Messenger and Prophet. In another verse it is stated that Moses, before facing Pharaoh, prayed to Allah to appoint Aaron as his vizier, because his tongue was more eloquent (eloquent) than that of Moses. Allah says: And make me a helper from my family, (namely) Aaron, my brother, strengthen my strength with (the presence of) him, and make him a friend in my affairs. (thaha\/20: 29-30-31-32)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains, when Musa (as) arrived at the place and time promised by Allah to receive the revelation, Allah had conveyed His revelation directly without an intermediary, then the desire arose in Musa to obtain another glory besides the glory of speaking directly with Allah. just received it. That desire is to have the glory of seeing God clearly, then Moses said, \"O my Lord, show me Your holy substance and give me the strength to be able to see You clearly, because I cannot see and know You perfectly. God replied, \"O Musa you will not be able to see Me.\" In the hadith of the Prophet, it is stated: \"From Abu Musa, he said: The Messenger of Allah said, \"Hijab (barrier) of Allah is nur (light). If the nur is revealed, surely the majesty of the light of his face will burn all creatures that reach the sight of God on him.\" (Muslim History) Then Allah said to Musa, \"Look at the hill, if the hill remains firm and strong as before after seeing Me, surely you can also see Me, because you and the mountain are My creations But if that sturdy and strong hill can't stand it and crumbles after seeing Me, how can you see Me? Because all the creatures that I created are unable and unable to see Me.\" Narrated from Ibn Abbas, he said, \"When Musa asked his Lord, \"Show me Your substance\" Allah replied: \"You will never be able to see Me.\" Then Allah confirmed again, \"You will not be able to see Me.\" Me for ever, O Musa.\" No one can see Me, then after that he will live.\" Finally Allah said, \"Look at that high and big hill, if the hill had remained in place, had not shaken and broken, surely he would have seen My greatness, hopefully you can see it too, while you are really weak and lowly. Verily, the mountain shakes and shatters no matter how strong and terrible it is, while you are weaker and lower.\" There are several opinions of commentators about what is meant by the verse: \"When the Lord appears to the mountains,\" some commentators say that what appears as a mountain is the substance of God. Regardless of the opinion of the mufassir, it seems that Allah is not what a creature looks like. However, God's appearance is not the same as human appearance according to God's attributes which cannot be measured by human size. After Musa as, realized from his fainting, and also realized that he had asked Allah for something that could harm him, he felt he had committed a sin, therefore he begged and prayed to Allah, Glory be to You, \"O my Lord, I sinned for asking something to You that is beyond the limits of my ability to accept it, therefore I repent to You and will not repeat mistakes like the past, and I am one of those who first believed in You.\" Mujahid said, \"Tubtu ilaika\" (I repent to You), meaning: I repent to You, because I have asked You to be able to see Your substance, \"wa ana awwalul muminin\", (I am the first person to believe in You) meaning that I am the first Israelites who believe in You. While in another narration from Ibn Abbas, he is the first person to believe and no one can see You (in the world)."

			"tafsir": "Furthermore, Allah explained that He had chosen Moses among the people in His time by giving gifts that were not given to other humans, namely appointing Moses as a Prophet and Messenger, giving him the opportunity to speak directly with Allah, even though he was limited by something that limited him between God and Moses. In the Qur'an, it is mentioned how Allah delivered revelations to His Messengers, as Allah says: And it is not proper for a human being that Allah will speak to him except through revelation or behind a veil or by sending a messenger (angel) and then having it revealed to him. with His permission what He wills. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise. (Asy-Syura\/42: 51) So according to this verse there are three kinds of ways Allah conveys revelation to His Apostles, namely: 1. By revealing to the Apostle concerned, namely by instilling an understanding into the heart of someone whose revelation was sent down to him. 2. Speak directly by using a barrier that separates God and the servant being spoken to. This second way was experienced by Musa in receiving revelation, so that he was known as Kalimullah. 3. By the intercession of the angel Gabriel as. The Quran was conveyed in this way. Regarding the issue of whether humans can see Allah in a real way, if one understands the verses and traditions of the Prophet, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. It is impossible for humans to see Allah as long as they live in the world, as Allah emphasized to the Prophet Musa as. 2. Believers can see Allah in the hereafter, according to: a. Allah's Word: \"The faces (of believers) that day will be radiant. Looking at their Lord.\" (Al-Qiyamah\/75:22-23) From this verse it is understood that \"seeing God\" on the Day of Judgment is one of the blessings that Allah has bestowed on those who believe, because of that they always hope for it. b. Words of the Prophet Muhammad: Truly people say (to Rasulullah SAW), \"O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgment?\" Rasulullah replied, \"Is there anything that prevents you from seeing the moon at full moon?\" They said, \"No, O Messenger of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"Then verily you will see God as you see the full moon.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim) c. Everything that exists can be seen. Only that which has no form cannot be seen. God is obligatory being, therefore God can be seen if he wills Him. Meanwhile God sees everything that exists, including seeing Himself. If God could see Himself, then He would also have the power to make people see Himself if He so desired. In the next verse, the Prophet Musa and his people are ordered to accept the holy book that Allah sent down, and the Shari'a that must be carried out to be used as a guide for life and practice in the world. Only in this way can they be considered grateful and appreciative of God's gifts."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains in this verse that He has sent down to the Prophet Musa as, several pieces of land containing instructions and teachings, promises and threats of religious principles, in the form of the principles of faith, morals and laws. The opinions of experts differ about what is meant by the sea including parts of the Torah, and some are of the opinion that the sea was revealed before the Torah was revealed. Of these various opinions, the strong opinion is that the sea was the first revelation revealed to Musa (as), because it contains general and global laws, creeds, and statements. Then another revelation was sent down to explain it gradually according to the needs, circumstances, time and place. Scholars of commentary differ on the number of lauh revealed to Prophet Musa (as). Some say ten and so on. There is no text that clearly explains the number of letters that were sent down. Allah ordered that Musa adhere to the principles of the religion that had been revealed to him, carry out all the instructions and laws, so that he would be happy in this world and in the hereafter. And God commanded that Moses and his people adhere to the teachings, instructions, and laws that were in the sea. So that the Children of Israel will have good manners, good worship, and the doors of shirk will be closed. If you and your people do not take and hold on to what We have sent down in truth, then you will become wicked, as has been experienced by the Ad, Samud, and Pharaoh people and so on, or We will show later what the people have experienced. who do not want to obey Me. From the verses above, several iktibar (lessons) can be drawn as follows: 1. It is obligatory to convey the teachings of the apostle seriously, in accordance with the treatises brought by the Apostle, so that thus the formation of a new ummah is achieved, full of peace under the protection of God Almighty. Merciful. This can be seen in the actions of the Prophet himself. He is a role model for his people in practicing God's commands. This can be seen in his words, deeds and actions. Because of that the Arabs were attracted to the religion they brought, so that in a very short time, the population of the Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam. The methods carried out by the Prophet have also been carried out by friends and some of the famous caliphs in history, so they have succeeded as the Prophet has succeeded. In the meantime there are also among the Muslims who have made mistakes. 2. We have seen in history that the Children of Israel became a great and powerful nation when they carried out Allah's religion well, and they became a colonized nation, living in misery when they looked down on and denied Allah's religion. 3. This is the case for the Muslims, they become strong and great when they carry out the religion of Allah well, when a strong brotherhood among Muslims arises, and they become weak when they ignore the religion of Allah."

			"tafsir": "Allah will turn away the hearts of those who are arrogant, arrogant to understand the evidence and arguments brought by the apostles, especially those related to the power and greatness of Allah, and also turn their hearts to carry out Allah's religion and follow the instructions to the path that Correct. This is also in accordance with the word of Allah: \"So when they turn away (from the truth), Allah turns their hearts away. And Allah does not guide the wicked people.\" (Ash-shaff\/61: 5) Takabur according to language means, \"consider oneself great\", or \"feel great\". What is meant by this verse is rejecting the truth and belittling other people. The temperament and character of someone who is arrogant looks down on other people, as if he is the only one who is smart, has the power, determines what happens and so on. Because of that, in his actions, he is easy to do acts that exceed the limits, do arbitrary and like to do damage. In this verse, the arrogant attitude is coupled with the words \"bigairil haq\" without any valid reason. This shows that the attitude and actions of arrogant people are carried out without thinking about the consequences caused by actions that are solely carried out to satisfy their own desires, even if they harm others. Takabur is a mental illness caused by errors in judging and accepting something. Sometimes a person's continuous success in his business can also lead to arrogance, resulting in excessive belief in himself, that whatever he aspires to and plans for will surely be achieved and successful. Feeling confident in one's own abilities, this eventually creates the belief that one is not dependent on anyone, nor does one depend on God. In this verse, the characteristics of arrogant people are explained, namely: 1. If they see evidence of Allah's power and greatness, or read Allah's verses, they do not believe them and do not want to take inspiration and lessons from them. The arguments, proofs of Allah's power and oneness as well as the verses of the Al-Quran which contain the truth they reject. These arguments and evidence are of no use to people who are doubtful and do not want the truth, because they feel that the truth itself will limit and prevent them from arbitrary actions, so that their aspirations and desires are not fulfilled. This verse is a signal to the Prophet Muhammad, that the polytheists and infidels made fun of him and belittled the Koran and wreaked havoc by finding faults and weaknesses in the verses of the Koran and distorting its contents and the truth of the Koran. If the Prophet Muhammad wanted to comply with their demands which are a condition for their faith in him, they would still not believe even though their demands had been met. 2. If they see directions and the right path, they don't want to follow it, they even avoid and stay away even though that path is the best and the only way that can lead them to a place full of happiness. 3. If they see a path leading to misery, they follow it, because Satan has made that way in his mind the best and most beautiful. They feel that by taking this path all their desires and desires will surely be fulfilled. According to their belief that is the paradise they aspire to. At the end of this verse, it is explained why Allah turned their hearts away, so they did not want to take lessons from Allah's verses, because they had denied Allah's verses. It has become God's law, that often doing a job, causes the work to be easier to do and in the end, the work and the people who do it become one, as if they cannot be separated anymore. Likewise, there is no difference between the evil deed and the person who always does it, so that in the end the person and the evil deed he has done have become one and have become one with him. Therefore, in essence, it is not God who turns away and locks the heart of someone who is astray, but the people who are astray themselves. In fact, Allah did not create humans from birth to be believers or unbelievers, nor did He force His servants to become disbelievers or believers, but someone became a believer or became a disbeliever on their own. It is they themselves who choose and try to become people of faith by following religious instructions and teachings by carrying out God's commands and keeping away from His prohibitions. He always pays attention to the signs of God's power and greatness so that their faith grows stronger and stronger. On the other hand, it is human beings themselves who try and choose a misguided path or become disbelievers by denying Allah's verses, belittling and ignoring Allah's verses, so that they can satisfy their desires and passions. Because they always commit sinful acts, those actions have united with themselves, so that any truth that comes is always rejected, as if their hearts have been locked away, turned away from the truth. This example is mentioned in the word of Allah SWT: And indeed, We will fill Hell with many from among the jinn and humans. They have hearts, but they do not use them to understand (the verses of Allah) and they have eyes (but) they do not use them to see (signs of Allah's power), and they have ears (but) they do not use them to hear (the verses of Allah) ). They are like livestock, even more astray. They are the ones who are heedless. (al-Araf\/7: 179) The behavior of people as explained in the verse above has been found in many societies throughout the history of human life. They are people who are greatly influenced by worldly life, such as rank, power, wealth, pleasures, and so on, they always follow their desires. They forget and deliberately forget religious teachings, both related to the implementation of God's commands and His prohibitions. If God's teachings are conveyed to them, then they carry them out simply to seek sympathy, so that their desires and desires are more easily fulfilled."

Samiri's name is mentioned in the Word of Allah SWT: He (Allah) said, \"Indeed, We have tested your people after you left, and they have been led astray by Samiri.\" (thaha\/20: 85) The calf statue was made of gold, which came from the gold jewelry of Egyptian women borrowed by the women of the Children of Israel which they brought with them when they left the land of Egypt. The gold jewelery was melted down and fashioned by Samiri into a calf statue. According to Ath-Tabari, the gold was borrowed from gold bracelets, a sign of the slavery of the Children of Israel by the native Egyptians. (Full tafsir see surahh Taha\/20: 85) The desire of the Children of Israel to worship a calf statue as a god besides Allah is the influence of their customs in ancient Egypt. In fact, their ancestors were muwahhidin (monotheistic experts) because they were descendants of the Prophet Yaqub. However, after associating with the Egyptians, the symptoms of wasaniyah (worshiping other than Allah) were contagious to them. This wasaniyah worship has been ingrained in them, always their desire arises to do this habit. The calf statue that was worshiped as a god by the Children of Israel, was in the form of a calf statue that was shaped in such a way that if the wind blew into it it could make a sound. The sound from the calf statue comes out because the wind enters the mouth cavity and comes out from another hole, causing a sound. This can be made by inserting a sounding pipe into the cavity of the calf. When the wind blows on the pipe, the calf statue sounds like a real calf. Because such a thing was considered strange by the Children of Israel, it was easy for them to believe that the calf had the right to be worshiped, as well as to worship God. Allah denounced the actions of the Israelites who were weak in faith, who could not distinguish between a God who had the right to be worshiped and something strange that they saw and knew for the first time. They cannot distinguish between God who sends revelations to the Apostles and God's creatures who can only speak. If they would think their own abilities might be better, and more able to speak than the calf. The Israelites did this without a strong argument, they did so only because of the influence of the customs of their ancestors in ancient Egypt who worshiped calves. Even though they had received clear evidence, such as splitting the sea, a stick becoming a snake and so on. Because they don't want to pay attention to the proofs and arguments, they deny Allah, which is bad for themselves. (See surahh Thaha verses 85-87)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the attitude of the Prophet Musa towards the actions of his people who had worshiped the calf. He was sad because he felt that all his hard work and struggles had not gotten the results he wanted. He was very angry with his brother Aaron who had been made his representative to lead his people after he left to meet his Lord's call to Mount Sinai, as if Aaron had not carried out his duties, and had let his people go astray, not rebuking and taking the slightest action against those who disobeyed. Musa also felt afraid of Allah and was worried about receiving Allah's wrath against him and his people who had become polytheists. In a state of sadness, despair mixed with anger, loud words were uttered towards his brother Aaron and his people, who stated that the task and mandate he had given to Aaron had been in vain, had not been carried out as it should. With great difficulty he has taught and educated his people, so that they have faith in Allah and worship only Him alone. He had just received Allah's revelation containing instructions and shari'a to be taught to his people. What happened to his people when he returned was quite the opposite of what he wanted. What he wants is for his people to continue to worship Allah Almighty after he dies, then the submission and obedience will increase, after he can teach the revelation he just received from Allah. While what is happening is the worst work and the biggest sin, that is to associate God. Then Musa said to his people. Why can't all of you wait for my return after worshiping God, until you make statues and worship them as if you were worshiping God, even though I was only ten nights late. Do you have any other prejudice against me because of my tardiness. According to a history, that Samiri once said to the Children of Israel when he showed them the calf statue he had just made to them: This is your god and the god of Musa, in fact Moses will not return and in fact he is dead. In his anger the Prophet Moses threw the tablets in his hands, but not intending to destroy them, as stated in the Old Testament, \"the anger of Moses was aroused; he threw the two tablets out of his hands and smashed them at the foot of the mountain.\" (Exodus 32:19). In fact in 7:154 those objects are still intact, containing God's teachings. It would be disrespectful (if not an insult to God) to assume that the Messenger of Allah had destroyed the tablets containing Allah's teachings in his uncontrolled anger. then took Aaron by the crown, because he thought that Aaron was not really trying to prevent the actions of his people worshiping the calf, and the actions that had been carried out while he was going to Mount Sinai, or reporting the deeds of his people who had gone astray. Musa's suspicion of Aaron is described in the word of Allah as follows: \"He (Moses) said, \"O Harun! what hindered you when you saw that they had gone astray, (so) did you not follow me?\" Have you (deliberately) disobeyed my order?\" (thaha\/20: 92-93) Musa's words were answered by Harun, \"O son of my mother, don't be in a hurry to reproach me, and don't be in a hurry to scold me, thinking that I am not serious about carrying out your orders and not hindering them.\" . Actually I have tried to prevent them from carrying out this misguided deed and gave advice to them. But they see me as a weak person, they even almost killed me. Do not act towards me in a way that pleases the enemy; they rejoice and laugh because of the disaster that befell me , do not put me in the group of people who like to do things that result in harm to myself, namely the group that worships calf statues, I myself am not one of that group.\" The different attitudes of Musa and Harun towards the actions of their people also show the different character of these two Prophets of Allah. Musa was a tough and firm person in dealing with a heretical act that was forbidden by God, while Aaron was a gentle person and did not want to use violence in dealing with a heretical act."

O my Lord, enter us into Your vast mercy and You are the Most Merciful God.\" With the prayer of the Prophet Musa, the hopes of those who wanted a split between Moses and Aaron disappeared, and those who wanted Moses to act harshly against his brother Aaron. This verse clearly states that Aaron was not involved in the actions of his people who worshiped the calf, according to his statement to his brother Moses."

As Allah says in Al-Baqarah\/2: 54: \"And (remember) when Musa said to his people, \"O my people! You have really wronged yourselves by making (statues of) calves (as an offering), therefore repent to your Creator and kill yourself. It is better for you with your Creator. He will accept your repentance. Truly, He is the Most Repentant, Most Merciful. (al-Baqarah\/2: 54) According to some commentators that the sentence, \"Thus we will repay those who tell lies\" in this verse was addressed to the Prophet Muhammad, as a warning to the Jews who were around Medina. at that time. As a result of their attitude and behavior (Jews) to the Prophet Musa before. If the Jews around Medina continued to behave like that, did not want to follow the Prophet Muhammad, with his call, then they would get destruction and humiliation in this world and in the hereafter, of course they would get a painful punishment. Adhering to one of these two opinions does not violate the contents of the verse, because one of the objectives of this opinion is to mention the story of the peoples of the past as a parable and parable for future generations. Hopefully the mistakes that were made by the ancients will not be repeated by future generations. This verse also warns that like the retribution mentioned in this verse, Allah will give vengeance to those who invent lies against Allah. Narrated from Abi Qatada, he said, \"This verse is not only addressed to the Children of Israel at the time of the Prophet Musa, but is addressed to all those who hold lies against Allah.\""

In this verse it can be concluded that no matter how big a sin a person has committed, Allah will surely forgive him, as long as he really wants to repent, and wants to carry out all the conditions of repentance in order to be accepted by Allah. Indeed, Allah does not immediately punish His guilty servants, but always gives them the opportunity to repent and regret the crimes they have done by doing good deeds that are pleasing to Allah."

			"tafsir": "Moses chose seventy chosen people from his people to go together to a place on Mount Sinai to worship his Lord. According to the mufassir, who was the chosen person and where was the place determined, Allah had previously revealed to Moses. The mufassir differed; Was Moses commanded by Allah to go to Mount Sinai with the seventy people chosen by the Children of Israel after they worshiped the calf with the intention of expressing repentance to Allah or at the same time asking Allah to show Himself clearly. If you look at the arrangement of the verses and the sequence of the story of Musa in surahh al-Araf, it can be concluded that Musa's departure with these seventy chosen people after the Children of Israel worshiped the calf statue, that is, after Musa returned to meet his Lord to Mount Sinai for forty days and four twenty nights. Moses departed with seventy chosen people to a predetermined place. So when they were shaken by an earthquake caused by a very powerful thunderbolt, Moses prayed to his Lord, \"O my Lord, You have indeed destroyed them, so I hope that You will destroy them before they go with me to this place, and that You will destroy me too, so that I don't face difficulties like this, which give them the opportunity to reproach and accuse me, that I have brought the elect to this place to be destroyed. Because You did not destroy them before I brought them here with me, let them not You destroy it now that I brought it here.\" In this verse, it is explained why the chosen Israelite leader was punished by Allah with a terrible thunderbolt. In God's word, it is explained why they were struck by lightning and the consequences they experienced. As He says: \"And (remember) when you said, \"O Musa! We will not believe in you until we see Allah clearly, \"then the lightning struck you while you watched it. Then, We resurrected you after you died, so that you would be grateful.\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 55-56) But in the Old Testament it is explained that the Children of Israel who worship idols (in the Koran the statue of a calf) are the Children of Israel seventy people chosen together with Aaron. They did this act of worshiping idols while on Mount Sinai, when the Prophet Moses himself appeared before God (read the Old Testament 31:2-35). In the Book of Numbers xvi: 20-25, it is mentioned about the disobedience and disobedience of the Children of Israel against Moses, then they were punished by Allah. While the Children of Israel who had run away were burned by a bolt of lightning. Then Moses begged God, \"Do not You, O Lord, destroy us because of the actions of people who lack sense who ask to see You.\" All of that is a trial from God against them. But they could not stand it and were not strong enough to face the trials, so they still urged Moses to let God show them His essence. Because of their actions they were punished with lightning (thunder) so that they all died. Then Allah brought them back to life so that they would repent and be grateful for the blessings Allah had bestowed upon them. Trials are God's tests for His servants, with these trials those who are not strong in faith will go astray, and with these trials He also guides His servants who have strong faith. Next Musa prayed, \"O our Lord, you are the one who takes care of all our affairs, oversees everything we do, so forgive us for all our deeds and actions that result in punishment for us. Give mercy to us, for You are the best Giver of mercy and Giver of forgiveness. Only You are the One who forgives all sins and forgives all our mistakes. Forgiving and pardoning is not for any particular purpose, but solely because of Your nature, which is Most Forgiving and Most Forgiving.\""

Indeed, we pray and repent to You, we promise not to commit forbidden acts and we return to true faith, and practice good deeds that You approve of.\" Allah said, \"My mercy comes to My servants more quickly than My anger, and My special punishment I bestow on My servants whom I want, namely those who commit evil, disbelief and disobedience. \" Regarding My mercy, favors and primacy, all of them cover the universe, not one of My servants does not receive Him, including the disbelievers, the disobedient people, the Jews, the Christians, and Muslims, calf worshipers and so on. In fact, if it were not for My grace, favors, and virtue, I would have destroyed the entire world, because most people are disbelievers, disobedient, who always do disobedience. \"And if Allah were to punish people for what they have done, surely He would not have left a single living moving creature on this earth, but He suspended (punishment) it, until the appointed time.\" (Fathir\/35: 45) Allah confirms that the mercy, the grace of Allah which He gives to the disbelievers, is temporary, not eternal, and imperfect, while the perfect and eternal mercy will be bestowed by Him on those who are pious and those who -people who pay zakat. In this verse it is called zakat, it does not mention any other charity that is no less valuable than zakat. This has something to do with the number of people who are reluctant to pay zakat compared to the number of people who are reluctant to do other charities that Allah has commanded. It is also a sign of the nature of the Jews who really love wealth and are reluctant to give up some of their wealth in the way of Allah. The special provision of mercy, favors and primacy to those who are pious and pay zakat is like Allah's decree specifically to those who confirm His verses, and acknowledge the oneness of Allah and the truth of His messengers who have been sent. Him with recognition based on knowledge and belief, not based on faith and the influence of the customs of their ancestors."

			"tafsir": "The characteristics of Muhammad as a Messenger are: 1. An unlettered prophet (illiterate) In this verse it is explained that one of Muhammad's characteristics was that he was not good at writing and reading. This characteristic gives an understanding that it is impossible for an Ummi to read the Torah and the Bible which are in the possession of Jews and Christians, as well as ancient stories related to ancient peoples. This proves that the message brought by Muhammad saw really came from God Almighty. It is impossible for someone who does not know how to write and read can make and read the Al-Quran and hadith which contain laws, scientific provisions that are of such high value. If the Koran was made by Muhammad, and not from the God of the Universe, humans would certainly be able to make or imitate it, but until now no human has been able to match it. \"And you (Muhammad) have never read a book before (the Koran) and you have not (never) written a book with your right hand; if (you have read and written), doubtless people who deny it.\" (al-Ankabut\/29: 48) 2. The arrival of the Prophet Muhammad has been reported in the Torah and the Bible The arrival of Muhammad as the final Prophet and Apostle is hinted at in the Torah (Genesis xxi. 13,18; Deuteronomy xviii. 15) and the Bible (John xiv. 16), in the Al-Quran it is clearly stated that they too already know Muhammad's personality and his morals: Those to whom We have given the Book (Torah and Gospel) know him (Muhammad) as they know their own children. Indeed, some of them must have hidden the truth, even though they knew (it). (al-Baqarah\/2: 146) Jews and Christians have hidden the news about Muhammad's coming by deleting this news and replacing it with another in the Torah and Bible. Many verses of the Koran that explain the actions of Jews and Christians change the contents of the Torah. Even so, there are still verses from the Old and New Testaments that hint at the coming of Muhammad. In the book of Genesis xi: 13 it is explained that there will come an end-time Prophet from the descendants of Ishmael. From the Torah there are several signs that can be used as evidence to state that the Prophet Muhammad was a prophet among prophets. This shows that those who are ordained by God will arise from the brothers of the Children of Israel, but not from the Children of Israel themselves. As for the brothers of the Children of Israel, they were Bani Ismail (Arabic race), because Ismail was his brother who was older than Isaac, the father of the Prophet Yaqub. And the Prophet Muhammad is clearly a descendant of the Bani Ismail. Then in Kalnest's book there is the word, \"Who is like you\" which gives the meaning that the prophet who will come must be like Prophet Musa, the Prophet who brought the new Shari'a (Islamic religion) which also applies to the Israelites, then it is explained again that the prophet is not arrogant, since before becoming a prophet. Before becoming a Prophet he was already popular with people, as evidenced by the title given to him by the Arabs \"Al-Amin\"; which means, \"One who is trusted\". If he was an arrogant person, of course he would not be given that highly commendable title. After becoming a Prophet he was more friendly and humble. The Christians adapt the Prophecy to Prophet Isa in addition to admitting that Jesus was killed (crucified). This clearly contradicts the verse of the Prophecy itself. Because the Prophet must not be killed. It is also stated that God has come from Mount Sinai, meaning to give revelation to Moses and it has appeared for them in Seir (Deuteronomy ii. 1-8)\", meaning to send down revelations to Prophet Isa, as well as the glittering light from Mount Paran, meaning to send down revelations to Muhammad saw. Paran (Faron) is the name of one of the hills in Mecca. In John xiv.16, xv.26 and xvi.7 the Prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad is mentioned as follows: \"Then there is when Periclytos comes, whom I have sent to you from the father, the true spirit that comes from the father, then he is a witness for me, while you have been a witness from the beginning. The word \"Periclytos\" is Greek, which means the same as \"Ahmad\" in Arabic. This is in accordance with the word of Allah SWT: \"And (remember) when Jesus the son of Maryam said, \"O Children of Israel! Indeed, I am God's messenger to you, confirming the book (which came down) before me, namely the Torah and giving good news to an Apostle who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad (Muhammad).\" (ash-shaff\/61: 6) parts of the Torah and the Bible that were changed, added and removed, also contained hints about the prophethood and apostleship of Muhammad saw. That is also why some Jewish and Hebrew scholars who acknowledged the truth of the news immediately believed in Muhammad and the message he brought, such as Abdullah bin Greetings from among the Jews, Tamim ad-Dari from among the Christians 3. The Prophet ordered to do ma'ruf and forbade doing wrongdoing that is ma'ruf is a good deed, which is in accordance with common sense, beneficial to themselves, humans and humanity and in accordance with the teachings whereas an unlawful act is a bad deed, which is not in accordance with common sense, and can cause harm for oneself, for man and humanity. The most valuable act of ma'ruf is acknowledging the oneness of Allah, and showing obedience to Him, while the worst unjust act is to associate partners with Allah. 4. Forbidding what is good and forbidding what is bad What is meant by good is what is lawful and good, does not damage the mind, mind, body and spirit. While what is meant by bad is that which is unlawful, which damages the mind, body, and spirit. 5. Removing various burdens and shackles that are burdensome The point is that the Shari'a brought by the Prophet Muhammad is no longer a heavy burden like that which was carried on the Children of Israel. For example, it is lawful to kill oneself or to kill one's lust for the validity of repentance, obliging qishash for murder, whether intentional or unintentional, without allowing the payment of diat, cutting off parts of the body that have committed a mistake, throwing away or cutting clothes that are unclean, and so on. In accordance with the word of Allah swt: \"God does not want to make it difficult for you, but He wants to cleanse you and perfect His favors for you, so that you are grateful\". (al-Maidah\/5: 6) Likewise Rasulullah SAW said: \"Give good tidings and don't give news that scares you, make it easy and don't make it difficult, be united and don't be in disagreement.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim) Indeed, the Children of Israel have hinted at severe laws, both the law of worship, and the law of muamalat. Then to the Prophet Isa, the strict laws of worship were issued. As for the Shari'a of the Prophet Muhammad, its nature is not burdensome, but makes it easier and less burdensome, both those related to the laws of worship and those related to the laws of muamalat. Allah explains the ways to follow the Prophet whose characteristics have been mentioned, so that they are happy in life in this world and in the hereafter, namely to believe in him and in the message he brings, help him with respect, uphold and exalt the religion he carries, follow the Al-Quran he brought."

(Saba\/34: 28) And Allah's word also: ... This Al-Quran was revealed to me so that with it I would give a warning to you and to those who reached (the Koran to him)...

I was helped by instilling fear of my enemies within a month's journey, and the earth was made for me as a mosque (place of prayer) and a tool for purification. So whoever from my people has come to him when he prays, let him pray (wherever he is), and make lawful for me the spoils that were not lawful to those before me, give me intercession, and another Prophet sent to the people only, while I was sent to all mankind.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Allah explains His oneness, that is, there is no god but Him, only He has the right to be worshiped, because He is the one who takes care of the heavens and the earth, governs the whole nature. He gives life to all living things and causes death to all that is dead. In this verse it is explained that there are three main powers of God: namely the possessor in the heavens and the earth, the only God who can be worshiped, the God who gives life and death. Then Allah ordered all people to believe in Allah and believe in the Ummi Prophet, believe in his revelations, namely the previous books and ordered people to follow this prophet. The unummi apostle purifies devotion to Allah, believes in the books that have been revealed to the previous prophets. After the command to believe, Allah accompanies it with orders for humans to carry out all the Shari'a brought by the Prophet Muhammad."

On a journey in the middle of the desert, his people were suffering from thirst, so Allah revealed to Moses that he should strike his staff against a rock. After Musa struck it, twelve springs of water gushed out from the rock, according to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel (al-Baqarah\/2: 60). For each tribe is provided a spring and they already know where they drink; to maintain order and avoid overcrowding. This incident was a miracle for Prophet Musa to prove his apostleship, and to show the power of Allah. If in the past he struck his staff into the sea so that a path was opened for the Children of Israel to escape from the pursuit of Pharaoh and his army, then in this incident Moses struck his staff against a rock, so that water came out of the rock to quench the thirst of his people. This incident besides being a miracle for Prophet Musa also shows the magnitude of God's grace that He has bestowed on the Children of Israel. In addition to this gift, Allah mentions other gifts that He has given to the Children of Israel, namely: 1. Allah protected them with clouds when they walked in the middle of the desert and during the scorching hot sun. If it wasn't for the clouds to protect them, they would surely be burnt by the hot sun. This happened when they left Egypt and after crossing the Red Sea. They arrived in the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and were stricken with scorching heat. Because of that they asked Moses to pray to God to give His help. So God helped them by bringing clouds that could protect them from the hot sun. 2. Apart from that, Allah also gave them a food called al-manna, a kind of sweet food like honey, which descends continuously from the sky, from dawn to sunrise. In addition, Allah also bestowed food on them a type of quail called \"shalwa\". 3. Allah ordered them to eat food that is lawful, which is good, beneficial for the body and spirit, mind and mind. Allah has bestowed His great gifts on the Children of Israel, but they did not want to be grateful, they even do things that are forbidden by Allah, disobey Him and His Messengers, which results in them getting His punishment and punishment. They are being tortured solely because of their own actions, not because Allah wants persecute them. It is mentioned in a hadith Qudsi: \"O My servants, I have made tyranny (prohibition) upon Myself, and I have made unjust (as an act) which is forbidden among you, so do not do wrong to one another (amongst each other). O My servants, you will never be able to cause harm to Me, so that I get harm because of it, and you all cannot benefit Me, so that I benefit from it \" (Hadith Qudsi is the word of Allah spoken or conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad, but he is not a verse of the Koran.History of Muslim)"

In verses 58 and 59 of surahh al-Baqarah Allah orders the Children of Israel to enter Baitul Makdis by bowing themselves as a sign of obedience and a sign of gratitude to Allah, because they have survived the pursuit of the enemy, and are also safe in that very heavy and difficult journey, and then ask Allah for forgiveness for all the sins they have committed. If they do all the orders. Allah will forgive all their sins and mistakes and will give them additional gifts and rewards. In verses 161 and 162 of surahh al-Araf it is understood that the Children of Israel have entered Baitulmakdis as commanded by Allah. Also they were commanded by God to dwell and settle in that land. However, the wrongdoers among them have not carried out Allah's commandments perfectly, in fact they have committed acts and actions contrary to these orders, even though the order came from a helper who freed them from misery and difficulties. They easily perverted the commandments. They do not enter Baitulmakdis humbly, and they do not ask to be freed from sin. As a result of their disobedience and disobedience, they were subject to a severe punishment. According to some commentators, the punishment that befell them was in the form of an epidemic of cholera which infected and infected some of them."

			"tafsir": "This verse was revealed in Mecca, when the Islamic religion began to be broadcast and conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad, who at that time had never had direct contact with Jewish scholars, and he was someone who did not know how to write and read, as Allah said: \"And you (Muhammad) have never read a book before (the Koran) and you have not (never) written a book with your right hand; if (you have read and written), doubtless those who deny.\" (al-Ankabut\/29: 48) This verse shows the miracle of the Koran which explains news, events, or incidents that have occurred in the past, without anyone giving the news, apart from God the Omniscient. This verse was addressed to the Prophet Muhammad so that he would explain to the Jews in Medina at that time, about the actions that had been carried out by their forefathers, who always denied the call of the Prophets, despite whatever evidence was presented to them. What tells about the actions and attitudes of their forefathers is the Prophet Muhammad, a Prophet who was illiterate, had never had contact with the Jews at the time of receiving this verse. Is this not sufficient proof for them, that Muhammad is truly the messenger of Allah? The qaryah referred to in the verse is as follows: some mention Ailah, some mention Tobaiah and some mention other cities. In the past the ancestors of the Children of Israel who lived in Ailah, a city on the Red Sea coast between the cities of Madyan and Sinai whose livelihood is fishing, have been tested and tried by Allah, to test their faith and obedience. They were ordered to worship every Saturday, and prohibited from fishing on that day. When a lot of fish appear on the surface of the water (sea) on Saturday that look tame and easy to catch, they violate Allah's prohibition on that day to catch fish and do not perform worship as Allah has commanded on that day. Thus Allah gave tests and trials to the Children of Israel. They could not stand it and could not stand it, they even violated Allah's prohibitions and did not carry out His commands. Because of their attitudes and actions, Sunnatullah (God's provision) applies to them, that is, whoever obeys God's commands and stops His prohibitions will be rewarded with the pleasures of life in this world and in the hereafter. On the other hand, whoever disbelieves in Him will have a miserable life in this world, while in the hereafter they will receive a painful punishment. Of course this Sunnatullah also applies to the wicked and the Jews who are in Medina, as it did to their ancestors."

In this verse it is also understood that not all of the ancestors of the Children of Israel ignored Allah's commands and violated His prohibitions on the Sabbath, some of them carried them out. From this verse it can also be seen that in responding to God's commands and prohibitions they are divided into three groups, namely: 1. Groups that ignore God's commands and violate His prohibitions on the Sabbath. 2. Groups that give advice to groups that ignore God's commands and violate His prohibitions. 3. The group that disputes the actions of the group that gave the advice. The second group said to the third group: \"We teach them a lesson, is to free ourselves from sinful acts and to carry out our duties, which is to prevent wrongdoing. We hope that these disobedient people will realize and return to the right path.\" and straight\". When the Children of Israel remained disobedient and refused to return to the way of Allah, and continued to ignore the advice that had been given, Allah inflicted a severe punishment on them and saved those who gave the advice. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of Allah will not befall the third group, while some other scholars are of the opinion that the punishment will also befall the third group, because those who obey are only the second group, while the third group does not forbid doing wrongdoing, even argues and blames those who forbid doing evil deeds."

Even have turned away from that teaching. It was as if they had forgotten it and there was not the slightest trace in them of the warning that had been given. Therefore, Allah confirmed that for them the Sunnatullah applies, namely Allah saves those who obey Him, and punishes those who are ungodly and disobedient, Allah explains that the Children of Israel are punished not solely because of the wickedness of those who violate the provisions of God's provisions on that Saturday, but also the wicked things they always do. According to Sunnatullah also that He punishes the disobedient people directly in the world, because of the sins they have committed, as the word of Allah swt: And if Allah punishes humans for their tyranny, surely there will be nothing left by Him (on earth) from creatures that creep even though.... (an-Nahl\/16: 61) And Allah forgives most of the mistakes of His servants as in His words: And whatever calamity that befalls you is because of what your own hands have done. , and Allah forgives many (of your faults). (asy-Syura\/42: 30) In this verse Allah will directly punish a people or nation in the world before they receive punishment in the hereafter, if the tyranny of that people or nation has a great influence and it is difficult to eliminate it in human life and humanity, as stated by Allah in His words: \"And guard yourselves from the torment that does not only befall those who are unjust among you. And know that Allah is very severe in His torments.\" (al-Anfal\/8: 25) The doom referred to has been inflicted on the earlier peoples who denied the call of the Prophets sent to them."

They will always live in humiliation and suffering until the end of time, because their actions are contrary to God's laws. In history it has been clearly proven that God's threat. After the time of Prophet Solomon, the Jews were fought by the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar, they were destroyed, many men were killed and many women were made slaves. Many of them were also taken to Babylon as captives. After that, they were colonized alternately by various kingdoms. Because of this, they suffered centuries of suffering due to the incessant wars. Finally they fell into the hands of the Romans until the time of Prophet Isa. During the Christian Roman era they no longer had power, they were even expelled from their country and scattered in several countries. Some of them fled to the Arabian Peninsula. Stay them in this area safely. But then after the religion of Islam came, they were hostile to the Prophet Muhammad. Even though he had given them freedom to live in an Islamic area based on an agreement with them. Because of their hostility and betrayal, the Muslims were forced to expel them from the Islamic area. Some of them were killed or killed because they sided with the polytheists during the war (Ahzab War). In the 20th century, they experienced indescribable suffering. During the second world war, many Jews fell victim to the rule of Nazi Germany. In America, in Europe and in Russia, they are still subjected to humiliation today. Even though the Jews now have a homeland (the State of Israel), they are still suffering, because of their attitude too, because humans in this world, especially Muslims, are hostile to them. The state of Israel was formed by expelling the Palestinian people who were the native inhabitants of the country. Such was the fate of the Jewish nation. Truly Allah's law applies to people who disobey His commandments and make trouble. But Allah's forgiveness and compassion are very large and wide for those who repent from their sins, return to Allah's way with full awareness, and by making improvements. Allah will definitely remove their suffering."

They are the Jewish people who lived at the time of the Prophet Muhammad who inherited the Torah from their ancestors and took everything that was contained therein for granted. Halal and unlawful laws, orders and prohibitions in the book they know, but they do not practice it. They put worldly interests first with all the vanishing splendor. They seek property by means of efforts that are free from moral and religious law, develop usury, eat bribes, favoritism in law and so on, because they think that Allah will one day forgive their sins. The Jews considered themselves God's beloved and the chosen nation. Such an assumption is only misleading their minds. Therefore whenever there is an opportunity to gain worldly benefits such as bribes, usury and so on, they are not wasted. Allah confirms the errors of their opinions and assumptions that are prolonged in error and immersed in material lust. God revealed the existence of a covenant bond between them and God listed in the Torah, that they would not say anything about God except the truth. But they distort the contents of the Torah, because they are driven by the desire to gain worldly benefits, even though they have understood the contents of the Torah well and are aware of the error of their actions. They should prioritize the interests of the hereafter by acting in accordance with God's instructions and the Torah rather than worldly gains. For those who are pious, the happiness of the hereafter is better than the limited happiness of this world. Why don't they reflect on such things? This verse explains that the tendency towards material things and material life is a factor that causes the deception of the Jews as a nation that has a state. Because of their great love for worldly life, they have lost their religious guidance and are dry in spiritual life. What happened to the ancient Jews may also happen to today's Muslims, because they prioritize material life more and put aside the spiritual life so that their actions are very far from the teachings of the Koran."

Allah commands their spirits to witness the sequence of events within themselves which prove His oneness, the miracle of the process of creation from a drop of semen to a human being with a perfect body, and possessing sensory perception, with amazing veins and nervous systems, and so on. God said to the human spirit \"Am I not your God?\" Then answered the human spirit, \"Yes (You are our Lord), we have witnessed.\" This answer is the acknowledgment of the human personal spirit from the very beginning of its existence that there is God Almighty, that there is no other God worthy of worship except Him. With this verse Allah intends to explain to humans that the nature of human events is based on belief in Allah Almighty. Since humans were born from the wombs of their parents, they have witnessed the signs of the oneness of Allah in their own events, Allah says in another verse: So set your face straight towards Religion (Islam); (according to) Allah's nature because He has created humans according to that nature. There is no change in Allah's creation. (ar-Rum\/30: 30) Allah's fitrah means monotheism. The Messenger of Allah said: \"No one is born except according to fitrah, it is his parents who make him a Jew, Christian or Zoroastrian. Just as animals give birth to children whose ears are perfect, do you know that there are defects in the baby animals?\" (Al-Bukhari Muslim, from Abu Hurairah) The Messenger of Allah in the hadith Qudsi: Said Allah Taala, \"Verily I created My servants inclined (to the religion of monotheism). Then the devils came to them and turned them away from their religion (monotheism) , then everything that I have made lawful for them is forbidden to them.\" (Al-Bukhari's history from Iyadh bin Himar) The rejection of the teachings of Tawheed brought by the Prophet was actually an act contrary to human nature and to the voice of their conscience. Therefore it is not true that humans on the Day of Resurrection will give excuses that they were negligent, never reminded to be one of Allah. Their own nature and the teachings of the Prophets always remind them to unite Allah and obey the Messenger's call and keep away from shirk."

There were several prominent people at the time of the Prophet who had read the holy books and knew that Allah would send a messenger at that time. Those who are ambitious hope that he will be sent as a prophet, like Umayyah, the famous poet from the Saqif tribe, some say that person is Abu 'a„mir ar-Rahib, others say the verse is not addressed to individuals, but to group, they are the people of Quraysh with the verses revealed to the Prophet, but they refused.

But the man has made his choice to go astray. He took a path contrary to his nature, turned away from his own knowledge, because he was driven by personal denial, namely the luxury of worldly life. He followed his passions and was tempted by Satan. All instructions from Allah are forgotten, the voice of his conscience is no longer heard. Allah's Word: \"Indeed, We have made what is on the earth as an adornment for it, so that We may test them, which of them is the best in deeds.\" (al-Kahf\/18: 7) Supposedly, people who are given knowledge and skills, improve their souls, place themselves to the level of perfection, fill their knowledge and faith with noble deeds accompanied by sincere intentions and true intentions. But the man, after being given favors by Allah in the form of knowledge about the oneness of Allah, he came out \"like a snake that comes out of its outer layer of skin and sheds it forever.\" In this verse the word insalakha is used, Ø§Ù†Ø³Ù„Ø® \"out of the skin, sheath or casing,\" that is, to put off the knowledge that Allah has given him, and remains a disbeliever as if he had not been given anything. Therefore in the next verse Allah likens it to a dog whose condition is the same whether it is burdened or left alone, it still sticks out its tongue. This man who has a dog-like nature, is classified as the worst human being. This illustrates greed for worldly goods. He always keeps his body and soul busy to hunt for worldly things, so that he appears as someone who is hungry and thirsty without being satisfied. His situation is like a dog sticking out its tongue, it seems that it is always thirsty and hungry and cannot be satisfied wanting water and food. This is also the parable of the people who deny the verses of Allah. They oppose it, either out of ignorance or because of their fanaticism towards the world which causes them to close their eyes to the truth and renounce it. They realized the truth that Muhammad brought, and acknowledged the errors and mistakes of their forefathers after they contemplated the proof of the truth that was brought by the Prophet. But such awareness and acknowledgment disappears from their souls because of their lust which only pursues worldly pleasures, for example, the desire for power and wealth. The Jews and the Arab polytheists rejected Allah's verses because they wanted to maintain their power and interests. They are afraid of losing the pleasures and luxuries of life. Satan has tempted them to slip from the nature of their occurrence, namely the tendency towards the monotheistic religion. The story of the man who has many similarities with those who oppose Allah's verses deserves attention so that they will reflect and think about Allah's verses honestly and objectively, free from feelings of hostility and personal interests."

Because by praying and making remembrance they always remember Allah, and their faith grows alive and fertile in their souls. the right one, for example by giving ta'weel or twisting the understanding so that it obscures the absolute perfection of God's attributes. Those who do so will be overwritten by Allah's punishment. Deviations or deviations from the names of Allah, the Most Perfect, take various forms, including: 1. Giving a name to Allah with a name that is not found in the Al-Quran or in the authentic hadith of the Prophet. All scholars agree that the names and attributes of Allah must be based on explanations from the Al-Quran and the hadiths of the Prophet (tauqifi). 2. Rejecting the names and characteristics that have been determined by Allah for His substance, or refusing to attribute an act to Allah because seeing that as inappropriate for His holiness or reduces His sanctity. Those who reject this see themselves as if they know better than Allah and His Messenger, what is worthy and what is not worthy of Allah. 3. Naming something other than Allah with a name that is only worthy of Allah. 4. Twisting God's names and attributes with their own tafsir so that they come out of their true understanding and intent, such as the notion that God's attributes are the same as those of humans, such as hearing, seeing, speaking, having a face, hands , feet, laugh, angry, happy and so on. Even though Allah has the characteristics of hearing, seeing and so on, hearing Allah is not the same as hearing a creature, seeing Allah is not the same as seeing a creature. Or understanding that gives takwil to the attributes of Allah in such a way that the attributes of Allah have no meaning at all. 5. Associating partners with Allah besides Allah in terms of names that are specific to Allah. Like using the pronunciation of Allah for an idol or the word Rabbul alamin."

This is because they do not understand Sunatullah in the growth of human development, that the fight between right and wrong, between right and wrong, of course the right will win. What is beneficial to humans trumps what harms them. Allah says: Actually, We throw the right (truth) to the wrong (unrighteous) then the right destroys it, then immediately (the wrong) disappears. (al-Anbiya\/21: 18) And again Allah swt says: As for the foam, it will disappear as something useless; but what is beneficial to humans, will remain on earth. Thus God made a parable. (ar-Rad\/13: 17) Allah's warning to those who oppose and deny Muhammad's apostleship, they will be destroyed by istidraj (gradually), has proven its truth. The Quraysh infidels who were very violent towards the Prophet Muhammad and his companions had suffered defeat in various wars against the Muslims. The Quraysh were deceived by their own greatness and power. Even though they always experienced defeat, they didn't realize that they were gradually heading towards ruin."

Why don't they also reflect on the essence of their preaching, as proof of their apostleship and the verses of the Al-Quran which establish the oneness and power of Allah. If they were willing to contemplate such matters, the truth would appear to them, and the accusation that the Prophet Muhammad was a madman would not come out of their mouths. He was their best friend since childhood, there was not the slightest hint of madness in him, as they had witnessed in their development of life. Allah tells in the Koran about their accusations with his words: \"Then do they not live the word (Allah), or has something come to them that never came to their ancestors before? Or do they not know their Messenger (Muhammad) , therefore they deny it? Or they say: \"That man (Muhammad) is crazy.\" In fact, he has come to bring the truth to them, but most of them hate the truth. (al-Muminun\/23: 68-69-70) Allah says: And they said, \"O he to whom the Quran was revealed, you (Muhammad) are truly mad.\" (al-Hijr\/15:6) The infidel Meccans used to accuse the Prophet Muhammad of being insane in fact, in fact, it had become a habit of the ancient infidel people to their prophets, such as the Prophet Noah, the Prophet Musa, and others.

Due to the absence of that potential, his soul does not respond to the contents of the Koran when it comes to it. In fact, he had a negative reaction, namely rejecting, not accepting the Koran. Even though the Apostle who came to bring the Al-Quran to him had noble morals, perfect reason, but because he had lost that willingness, the Al-Quran still had no effect on the soul of the person who was led astray by Allah. His soul has darkened, does not accept the teachings of the Koran. Because of that there is no guiding light for him. His dark heart grew darker due to wrongdoing and tyranny that exceeded limits.

			"tafsir": "Allah in this verse emphasizes that only He knows when the Doomsday will occur. The certainty of the occurrence of the Day of Judgment and what will happen on the Day of Judgment has been explained in many ways by the Al-Quran. However, nothing specifically pertains to the time of the Day of Judgment is explained in the Al-Quran. It is only in the knowledge of Allah alone. We can draw a lesson from this warning, that no human being knows when the Doomsday will occur. This means that we should not believe in people's predictions or news that the Day of Judgment will occur on a certain day, date, month and year or at a certain time. This warning applies generally to any time. It turns out that until our time this has indeed happened frequently, whether in the Western world, in Africa or in our own homeland, there are people or groups who believe that the Day of Judgment is near, it will occur at certain times by mentioning when it will happen. happening. Many people believe and are deceived by predictions or news made by people claiming to be religious leaders, as a result some have claimed victims. Those who ask when the Doomsday will occur are the Quraysh. This verse was revealed in Mecca. In Mecca there were no Jews who informed and taught the Quraysh about the apostleship, the resurrection day, heaven and hell. Unlike the case with the Arabs of Medina who had a lot of association with the Jewish people. They already have an understanding of prophecy and the day of resurrection. If the Quraysh ask about the Day of Judgment then in fact the question is based on their assumption that the Day of Judgment is impossible and is a lie, Allah illustrates their thoughts with His words: People who do not believe in the Day of Judgment ask that the Day of Judgment be it will happen soon, and those who believe are afraid of him and they are sure that the Last Hour is true (will happen). Know that in fact those who argue about the occurrence of the Doomsday have really gone astray. (asy-Syura\/42: 18) Because the content of the question was denial, the Prophet Muhammad was asked to answer it with a very wise answer, the Prophet replied that the question of when the Doomsday would occur was not a human problem, nor was it the Prophet's problem, but that problem belonged to God only. Only He knows when the doomsday event will occur, and how the process will occur. The Prophet was assigned by Allah, to warn about the certainty of the Day of Judgment and the awesomeness that occurred at that time according to the news of the Al-Quran. The Quraysh wanted to provoke an answer from Rasulullah saw, and from that answer they intended to ridicule and belittle him. His secrecy at the time of the Day of Judgment contains great wisdom for those who believe. They resignedly hand over the problems that will occur on the Day of Judgment only to Allah. He is the one who will open the veil of secrecy, no one else will accompany him or intercede with His servants to inform when the Day of Judgment will occur. The prophets are only tasked with warning about the Day of Judgment. Indeed, the Day of Judgment is a heavy burden for the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, because on that day all their deeds will be accounted for. And it's also difficult for them, because they don't know when the apocalypse will occur. The Doomsday will happen suddenly when they are heedless and unaware of it. For people who are busy with good deeds, and rely on Allah to face the last day. Whenever such catastrophic events occurred, he was prepared to deal with them. Then Allah confirmed again to the Prophet Muhammad, that the polytheists asked him about the Day of Judgment, because they assumed it was as if the Prophet knew it. If the Prophet did not know it, the Prophet could directly ask Allah. So Allah ordered again to the Prophet to emphasize that when the Day of Judgment will occur is still Allah's secret, He alone knows when the Doomsday will occur. no one else knows, and no one will be given knowledge to know why Allah has kept the doomsday a secret and what wisdom is contained in keeping it a secret. And many people don't know what to ask and what not to ask. According to Zahir, the Prophet Muhammad did not know when the Doomsday was, he only knew that it was near. The Prophet Muhammad said: \"I was sent and the coming of the Day of Judgment was like these two, while showing his index finger and middle finger.\" (History of at-Tirmizi) Meaning that the distance between him and the Day of Judgment is as close as the distance between the two fingers. Even though Allah kept secret when the Doomsday occurred, Allah had informed the Prophet Muhammad about the signs before the Doomsday occurred. As the word of Allah swt: So what else are they waiting for other than the Day of Judgment, which will come to them suddenly, because the signs have really come. So what is the use for them of their awareness, when (the Day of Judgment) has come? (Muhammad\/47: 18) So a clear sign that the end of the world is near, is the sending of the Prophet Muhammad as the last Prophet to mankind. With his revival, religious guidance by Allah to humans was perfected, meaning that spiritual life and material life were also perfect, but after this material life reached its peak, destruction and annihilation came. In the hadith there are many signs that explain the occurrence of the Day of Judgment. Among them is that man's desire to have material possessions or needs conflict with his desire for spiritual satisfaction. At one time humans put spiritual needs first, and material needs were defeated. Then material needs are won again along with the development of error, evil, evil and disbelief, until the Doomsday comes when humans wallow in crime."

The Prophet Muhammad himself, even though he was close to Allah, did not control the benefits and harms so that he could arrange according to His will. At first, the Muslims thought that everyone who becomes an Apostle must know about things that are unseen, have abilities beyond the capabilities of ordinary humans, either to seek some advantage or to refuse something that is harmful for himself or for others. In order to correct this erroneous view, Allah ordered the Messenger of Allah to explain that the position of the Apostle had nothing to do with such a thing. The Messenger is only a guide and guidance giver, he does not have the power to create or annihilate. What he knows about the unseen is what God tells him. If the Prophet had known about the unseen, for example knowing the events of the coming day, the Prophet would have prepared himself physically, mentally and materially to face that event and surely he would not be in trouble. Actually the Prophet Muhammad was an ordinary human being. The difference with ordinary people lies only in the revelation he receives and the task assigned to him, namely to provide guidance and teaching that has been outlined by Allah for humans.

When a person has reached adulthood, the desire to live together as husband and wife arises, and he will experience inner turmoil if that desire is not fulfilled. Because in a husband and wife pair that peace is manifested. Tranquility will not materialize in humans outside of living in a husband and wife pair. So the purpose of the presence of a wife for a man in Islam is to create a life in pairs itself. Islam requires humans to live as husband and wife, because in such a life situation humans find peace and happiness spiritually and physically. When the two husband and wife get together, the wife begins to conceive seeds. At the beginning of the growth of the seed it was light. First of all the cessation of menstruation and then the seed continues to process, slowly. So when their wombs started to get heavy, the parents prayed to Allah so that both of them would be blessed with children who were pious, perfect in body, virtuous, capable of carrying out their duties as human beings.

Why do they pray to idols who are actually Allah's creatures like them, who are subject to Allah's will and iradat. It would be utterly illogical for them to ask the idols for something they themselves, and also for the idols to be unable to attain. They should offer prayers to Allah the Creator and Ruler of all causes and effects in this world. All inanimate objects and living things in nature are all subject to His Sunnah. However, if the polytheists believe that their belief is true, namely that idols are able to provide benefits or prevent harm that humans cannot do, then let them pray to the idols if the idols can indeed be granted.

Telling people to do ma'ruf (good) Understanding urf in this verse is maruf. Meanwhile Maruf is good community customs, which do not conflict with Islamic religious teachings. In the Al-Quran the word \"maruf\" is used in relation to important laws, such as in government law, marriage law. socially the word \"maruf\" is used in the sense of custom and muamalah in a society. Because of that it is different -different according to differences in nation, country, and time. Among the scholars there are those who give the definition of \"maruf\" with what is considered good to do according to human nature that is pure and not contrary to common sense. For Muslims the main thing is to stick to the strong texts of the Al-Quran and Sunnah. Then heed the customs and norms that live in society as long as they do not clearly conflict with religious texts. 3. Ignoring disturbances by ignorant people What is meant by ignorant people are people who are always rude and cause disturbances to the Prophets, and cannot be awakened.

If they feel that there is an urge within them to commit evil, they immediately realize that this is a temptation by the devil and they immediately say a prayer of istiadzah and surrender themselves to Allah so that they are protected from the wiles of the devil. Thanks to that awareness, they are spared from the abyss of destruction and Satan's nets, because they can prevent themselves from falling into Satan's trap, while those who enter Satan's trap are only people who are heedless of God and lack self-awareness. The most effective weapon to cast out demons is remembering and muraqabah (drawing closer) to Allah in all circumstances. Always remember that Allah will instill into the soul the love of truth and virtue, weakening negative\/bad tendencies. A soul filled with faith is a healthy soul. A healthy soul is like a healthy body that has immunity. A body that has immunity, a strong body, is not easily attacked by disease. Bacteria and disease germs cannot reproduce in a body that is full of immune power. Likewise, the soul of a pious person is not easily defeated by Satan's temptations. The pious person immediately reacts to the satanic stimuli that arise in him. The reaction is in the form of remembrance of Allah accompanied by awareness of Satan's deception with all its consequences. Maintaining a healthy soul from Satan's temptations is the same as maintaining a healthy body, which requires continuous care to keep it clean and healthy, requires constant muraqabah, remembers Allah in all circumstances. Thus Satan does not get a chance to interfere with himself."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the ignorant and disbelievers help Satan in misleading and doing damage. Because ignorant people are always influenced by Satan and don't remember Allah. If animal passions arise in them, they give vent to them in the form of animal actions and deeds. There is no soul power that stems the animal lust. Because of that they continue to do damage and wallow in error."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains the behavior of Satan's companions in their efforts to oppose the Prophet Muhammad, when revelations did not come to the Prophet Muhammad due to delays in the revelation of the verses, then the polytheists urged the Prophet Muhammad to create those verses himself. Their insistence actually implies a denial of the Al-Quran which was revealed by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. Because they see the Al-Quran as a mere creation of the Prophet Muhammad, because it can be made at any time. So Allah ordered the Prophet to explain to them that the Al-Quran was a revelation from Allah which was revealed to him. The Prophet only followed what was revealed to him. It was not his right to pressure Allah to create something. The Prophet could only wait for the revelations to be conveyed to him, to be conveyed to his people as well. If not, he cannot change the Koran himself because the Koran is the word of Allah, it has three functions for believers as explained by Allah in this verse. First As a clear proof from Allah to show His oneness, the prophet Muhammad and the Day of Judgment. Whoever pays attention to and meditates on the contents of the Al-Quran, of course, will be sure that the Al-Quran is from Allah SWT. Second, as a guide or guide that guides humans in seeking the truth and the straight path. Third As a mercy in human life in this world and in the hereafter for those who believe. The Al-Quran provides rules and teachings that are easily understood and easily implemented by Muslims for their daily lives."

			"tafsir": "It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that this verse was revealed because the Companions were praying behind the Messenger of Allah while talking. Allah in this verse commands believers to pay serious attention to the Al-Quran. Let them listen as well as possible to understand its contents, take lessons from it and practice it sincerely. The words of the Messenger of Allah: Whoever listens (in earnest) to verses from the Koran, written for him double goodness and whoever reads it, will be a light for him on the Day of Judgment.\" (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Imam Ahmad from Abu Hurairah) the believers are calm when the Koran is read, because it is in that calm that they can contemplate its contents. Do not let their minds wander when the Koran is heard, so they cannot understand the verses properly. Allah will bestow mercy His to the Muslims when they fulfill Allah's commandments and live up to the contents of the Al-Quran. There are several opinions regarding the command to listen and be calm when the Al-Quran is recited: 1. It is obligatory to listen and be calm when the Al-Quran is recited based on this order, whether in prayer or outside prayer. That is the opinion of Hasan al-Bashri and Abu Muslim al-Ashfahani. listen and be calm, but especially in the Prophet's readings in his time and the faith readings in prayer, as well as the preacher's readings in the Friday sermon. 3. Listening to Al-Quran readings outside of prayers and sermons such as receptions is seen as highly recommended so that we receive God's grace."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah commands the Messenger and his people to recite the name of Allah or make remembrance of Him. Whether it's remembrance by reciting the Koran, tasbih, tahlil, prayer, or other praise according to religious guidance, with tadharru and a soft voice at all times, especially morning and evening, so that we are not classified as negligent. Then Allah outlines for us the manners and ways of reciting or mentioning Allah's name as follows: 1. It is best to do dhikr in a soft voice, because this is easier to lead to good contemplation. It is narrated that on a journey. The Prophet heard people praying in a loud voice, he said to them: \"O people, have mercy on yourselves, in fact you do not call on those who are deaf or who are far from you. Indeed, what you call is Allah, All-Hearing and Most Near. He is nearer to you from the (camel) neck of your vehicle\". (History of Ibn Majah) 2. Remembrance can be done in the heart or verbally, because remembrance in the heart shows sincerity, far from riya, and close to Allah's favor. Dhikr can be done verbally, verbally say and heart follow it. 3. Dhikr can also be done in congregation, with the aim of educating people to get used to doing dhikr."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah explains that angels whose positions are exalted in the sight of God do not feel heavy and are reluctant to worship Allah. Let humans imitate the angel's obedience to God. The angels always purify Allah from qualities that are not worthy of Him, and from worshiping idols. The angels prostrate and pray to Allah swt. This verse is the first verse of the prayer mat in the Al-Quran. It is circumcised for Muslims to prostrate after reading or hearing this verse recited. Abu Darda narrates as follows: \"That the Messenger of Allah saw this verse as one of the prayer rug verses in the Al-Quran\". (History of Ibn Majah)"
