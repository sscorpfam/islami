In the previous surahh, the general destruction of some of the former ummah was narrated and in this surahh adh-dzariyat the details are given. The surahhs that initially contained an oath in hijaiah letters (fawatihus-suwar) are usually intended to reinforce one of three elements, namely monotheism, apostolate and resurrection. In the surahhs that are intended to strengthen monotheism, oaths are usually used with immovable objects, and to strengthen faith about the Day of Resurrection an oath is used with moving objects because resurrection contains collection and separation which is more appropriate to be associated with objects. moving object. The Arabs are very afraid of perjury because of the terrible and accursed consequences. Therefore, every serious oath by them is highly considered, especially if the one who swears it is Allah swt. In these verses Allah swears, \"By the strong wind that blows away the dust with a very strong and terrible blow. And by the clouds whose lumps contain a lot of rain. And the ships that sail back and forth in the sea with ease. And with the angels who share all the affairs that are borne by them such as arranging the journey of the planets and stars, the matter of sending down rainwater, sharing sustenance, and so on.\" The verse above invites us to think about the wind. Wind is a mass of air that moves from areas of high pressure to areas of lower pressure. The cause of this pressure difference is the temperature difference. At a constant volume, an increase in air temperature will increase its pressure. But in reality, in nature, an increase in air temperature in a place will cause an expansion of air volume and an upward flow of air, so that the air density in that place will decrease and it will be filled with air masses from cooler places. So basically this air movement is controlled by the energy generated by temperature differences in different places on the earth's surface. With its movement, the wind also acts as a radiator to balance the air temperature. Without winds the temperature in desert areas would be much hotter than they are today, as well as in cold areas it would be very freezing. Adequate wind movement energy can provide many benefits to humans, such as for shipping, turning a mill for energy generation. Out of human control the wind plays an important role in pollinating flowers to become fruit and transporting seeds and spores for plant dispersal. Another phenomenon that occurs is the creation of waves in the ocean. Air movement can also occur with such great energy that it causes disasters and losses, for example in the form of hurricanes and typhoons. By the wind Allah swears in the next verse (adh-dzariyat\/51 verse 4): And who divides the affairs. With the wind, so many events that occur due to its gusts."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah swears: By the heavens which have orbits where the stars and planets circulate. According to Quraish Shihab, the word al-hubuk can mean beautiful and good or orderly. It can also be understood as the plural form of habikah or hibak, namely roads, like streets that are visible on the water when a gust of wind hits them. In the physical theory of general relativity, it is known about the mechanism of shortening very long distances to only a few meters. Einstein called it a bridge (bridge) and today scientists call it a wormhole (wormhole). This wormhole is a shortcut that connects two places in this universe. As an illustration, we want to travel to a galaxy that is located 100 million light years from the earth (if 1 light year = 9.46 x 1012 km, then the galaxy is about 9.46x1018 km from the earth, or 9.46 million-million- million kms!). Can't imagine when we get to that galaxy. If there was a space shuttle that could travel anywhere near the speed of light it would take us 100 million years! But if we use the 'wormhole' shortcut, we will arrive at today's galaxy. It should be noted that this is a consequence of the shortening of the distance that occurs within the wormhole. Thus it could be, al-hubuk in the form of a path as described by physicists, a wormhole, a 'special path' given by Allah to the Angels and His chosen servants. The journey of the Prophet during the Isra' Mi'raj, may have gone through a mechanism of shortening the distance so that such a long distance was traveled by the Prophet in just a few hours."

Is it proper for Allah to let them live in vain, even though Allah did not create human beings in vain, and will surely hold the day of resurrection and the day of reckoning?

That is a person who is mahrum and does not get a share.\" (History of Ibn Jarir from Abu Hurairah) In the Qur'an there are three groups of verses that are always side by side, cannot be separated, namely the command to pray and pay zakat, the command to obey Allah and His Messenger, and the command to give thanks to Allah and secondly mother father.

And Allah swt has power over all of that, He is never tired or lethargic and never feels tired either. This verse indirectly refutes the words of the Jews who say that Allah made the heavens and the earth for 6 (six) days, but on the seventh day Allah rested and lay down on His Throne because he was tired. The word 'sky' is widely used in various verses of the Qur'an. This word, in several verses has the meaning of the universe. Likewise in the verse above. The universe is not something static. The universe is something dynamic, always changing, and expanding. This was revealed after the science of astronomy has progressed very rapidly. This situation was actually mentioned in the Qur'an 14 centuries ago, when the science of astronomy was still very primitive. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the universe was only known as something that had been created at an unknown time, and had the form we see today. Research, observations and calculations using available modern technology reveal that the universe had a beginning, and until now it is regularly expanding. The universe is the cosmos, namely space and all the celestial bodies contained in it, including all the galaxies (star systems), whether known or unknown to humans. The universe, or universe, is inconceivably vast. Scientists measure distances in the universe in light years. One light year is equal to 9.46 trillion km. The most distant part of the universe that humans \"know\" is at a distance of 15 billion light years. At that distance are found countless super clusters of galaxies. The star closest to the sun is about 4.3 light years from Earth. The sun and all the stars that we can see with the naked eye are in the solar system's cluster of galaxies, otherwise called the Milky Way cluster. Throughout the universe, there are billions of galaxies that are rapidly moving away from each other. Galaxies are estimated to fill space up to a distance of 10,000 million light years from Earth. If in one second, light travels ï‚± 200,000 km, what is the actual area of outer space? Allah has expanded the universe so widely since it was created. The expansion of nature continues throughout time. This is in accordance with the expansion theory which states that nebulae, prospective stars, move away from the Milky Way galaxy at different speeds. In fact, the celestial bodies in one galaxy are being pulled away from each other. Researchers began to conduct research on the movement of celestial bodies in the 1920s. It is believed that the 1920's was an important moment in the development of modern astronomy. In 1922, the Russian physicist Alexander Friedman produced calculations showing that the structure of the universe was not static. He stated that the slightest cause was enough to cause the structure of the universe to expand or contract according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. George Lemaitre, a cosmologist from Belgium, was the first to realize the meaning of Friedman's calculations. Based on these calculations, Lemaître, stated that the universe had a beginning and that it expanded as a result of something that had triggered it. The theoretical thinking of these two scientists has not attracted much attention. This thought would probably have been abandoned, had it not been for new observational evidence that rocked the scientific world in 1929. That year, the American astronomer, Edwin Hubble, made the most important discovery in the history of astronomy. While observing a number of stars through his giant telescope, he found that their light was shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. The shift is directly related to the change in the distance of the stars from the earth. His observations found that a galaxy one million light years away from Earth was moving away at a speed of 168 km per year. A universe, in which the heavenly bodies regularly move away from each other, indicates that the universe itself is also expanding. Observations in subsequent years revealed and confirmed this conjecture. The stars aren't just moving away from the earth; they also stay away from each other. The only conclusion that can be derived from these findings is that the universe is \"expanding.\" A confirmation to a statement that is in the Qur'an, long before it was known to mankind. This discovery shook the foundations of the model of the universe believed at the time. His findings are recognized worldwide. However, the calculations were deemed wrong, and were revised later. According to some scientists, one day, it is estimated that this universe will no longer develop. It will shrink and come back together as before. If the cataclysmic explosion event which is a sign of the formation of various planets, and the separation of heaven and earth, is called the Big Bang; hence the shrinking and merging of the universe is called the Big Crunch."
