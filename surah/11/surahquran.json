After that Allah explained that the Qur'an is a book whose verses are neatly arranged and concise, and the meaning is clear. Because of the neatness and density of the arrangement of the verses, it is impossible to change the words, either the location or the letters. In addition, the verses are explained in detail according to the problem and scattered in the surah. There are verses related to faith, law, morals, stories, and some are related to science, such as the process of human occurrence. Thus the verses of the Qur'an are like a crystal ball which reflects various brilliant lights and has a high overall value. Indeed, the Al-Qur'an, with the harmony of the editorial composition of the verses and detailed explanations according to their contents, was sent down from Allah, the All-Wise, All-Knowing, Wisely, He sent down verses according to the needs of His servants, what is good for them. , because He is All-Knowing of all things."

Therefore, this verse starts with the prohibition. The Messenger of Allah is only a bearer of a warning about Allah's punishment for those who associate partners with Allah, and a bearer of good news about the reward for those who are obedient and sincere in worshiping Allah. Calling people to worship God is the task of the apostles since ancient times. Allah's Word: And We did not send any messenger before you (Muhammad), but We revealed to him, that there is no god (who has the right to be worshiped) besides Me, so worship Me. (al-Anbiya\/21: 25)"

After that they should return to Allah, obediently do His commands and worship Allah wholeheartedly and not worship other than Allah, such as statues and idols and so on. If they ever do that, let them ask forgiveness and repent steadfastly and continuously. Allah will surely forgive them and give them abundant sustenance, prosperity, health and well-being until the end of their lives. Thus, sincere faith in Allah and the Messenger of every individual, is the main factor that causes prosperity and happiness in life. Allah's Word: Whoever does good, both men and women in a state of faith, We will surely give him a good life and We will reward him with a better reward than what they have done. (an-Nahl\/16: 97) Apart from giving the enjoyment of life in the world to believers, Allah also gives to people who have virtue, such as people who have knowledge or great works, rewards in this world and rewards in the hereafter. But if people turn away from the faith and do not repent and even continue to engage in polytheism, disobedience, and moral decay, they will experience destruction or poverty to live according to the Sunnah of Allah on mankind and Allah's punishment in the Hereafter."

Astronomy scholars have determined that the days that have to do with the circulation of the stars are not the same as the levels of days that apply on this earth. Then Allah explained that His throne before the creation of the heavens and the earth, was on water. The Throne or Throne of Allah belongs to the unseen realm, which cannot be perceived with the five senses, and it is also impossible to imagine or imagine its shape and appearance, let alone how God resides on that throne. The verses that explain this are mutasyabihat verses, the truth of which we must believe by submitting their understanding to Allah. Umm Salamah, Rabi'ah and Malik narrated that the Companions in interpreting mutasyabihat verses like that always said, \"Istiwa (His residence) is known but the way is not known.\" This verse shows that what is under Allah's Throne is water which Allah made as the main ingredient in creating living things as He says: And did the disbelievers not know that the heavens and the earth were together, then We separated them? ; and We made every living thing out of water; then why do they not believe? (al-Anbiya'\/21: 30) Then Allah explained that the purpose of creating the heavens and the earth in six periods, and the existence of the 'Throne above the water, which is the basic element of all living things is to test which of the humans is better his deeds. Allah has provided all that is on this earth for human use, as His word says: It is He (Allah) who created all that is on earth for you. (al-Baqarah\/2: 29) All humans who are on the surface of the earth are ordered to try with all their might and abilities, to take advantage of the contents of nature, to explore the benefits of this universe, which is on earth, in the sea and in the air like minerals found in the bowels of the earth, at the bottom of the sea and so on, so that the maximum benefits can be extracted, to be used by all mankind, as a gift from Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah created the heavens and the earth as a test for humans, which of them has the strongest faith and the best deeds, the most meritorious for humanity, who has the most outstanding skills, who has the highest production results, who is the most honest and sincere in his business. etc. Of course Allah does not only test him, but also pays attention to the results of his tests, and gives a reward in proportion to his services. Allah's reward is given after the Day of Judgment. However, if the Prophet Muhammad told the polytheists in the city of Mecca that they would be raised after death to account for all their deeds while in the world, then they would answer, \"What you put forward from the Qur'an is just magic, to suppress us and to prevent us from the pleasures and delights of this world.\""

Their demand was that if he really was a prophet, why wasn't wealth (wealth) revealed to him or why didn't angels come to him to confirm his apostleship. Such remarks are also explained in another word of Allah: And they said, \"Why did this Apostle (Muhammad) eat food and walk in the markets? Why was not an angel sent down to him (so that the angel) gave warning with him, or (why not wealth is sent down to him or (why is there no) garden for him, so he can eat from (the yield) of it?\" (al-Furqan\/25: 7-8) Speeches of this kind which contained denial and ridicule which caused constriction of the chest in the people he faced were also experienced by the Prophet Muhammad himself. At first it was feared that he would be swayed by such utterances, that he would leave behind some of the revelations which had been revealed to him. However, the Prophet Muhammad was protected from such actions and he consistently carried out his treatise perfectly according to the word of Allah: And if We had not strengthened your (heart), you would have almost leaned a little towards them. (al-Isra\/17: 74) Likewise Allah's word: Then perhaps you (Muhammad) will harm yourself because of grief after they turn away, if they do not believe in this information (Al-Quran). (al-Kahf\/18: 6) Allah explains that the Prophet's position is only as a warner and his task is only to convey Allah's commands to his people.

After that it was explained that they already knew Muhammad. He had been hanging out among them for decades, and they never found him lying or breaking a promise to earn the title al-Amin. With a character that has been known for his honesty since before he was appointed as a prophet, it is not natural for him to suddenly turn into a fraud or a liar as they accuse him of, namely making up the Al-Quran and saying it is from Allah. A writer, no matter how clever and proficient he is in writing an essay, of course, can be imitated or matched by other writers. However, the polytheists were unable to create surahhs similar to the Koran, even though they, as leaders of the Quraysh, were poets, linguists, and accomplished writers, because their literary works in the form of poetry were often exhibited and even competed in musabaqah arenas. the beauty of language at the Ukadh market, dzul Majaz, and Majannah.

If this matter were made part of the apostleship, of course many people would follow the prophet because they wanted to guarantee sustenance and wealth. Even though the main idea of the apostolic task is to purify the human soul from material influences with worship and knowledge of Allah in preparation for entering heaven and obtaining His pleasure on the Day of Resurrection. Wealth and children are of no use anymore, and only those who are pure in heart face God. Furthermore, Prophet Noah said that he did not know the unseen. He does not exceed other people with magic, which can reveal hidden objects to increase wealth, or obtain benefits and reject harm, which can be conveyed to all his followers, so that they become rich people and so on. It is also mentioned in the word of Allah: Say (Muhammad), \"I have no power to bring benefit or reject harm to myself except what Allah wills. If I knew the unseen, I would have done as much good as possible and no harm would have happened to me. I am only a giver a warning, and a bearer of good tidings for those who believe.\" (al-Araf\/7: 188) Prophet Noah continued his statement by saying that he was not an angel sent to them, but a human being like them who was assigned to call people to monotheism. In Noah's words, there is an objection to the assumptions of unbelievers who say that an apostle should be an angel, not eating, not drinking, not going in and out of the market, must know all that is unseen, and has many advantages over humans. normal. He also does not say to the believers whom they humiliate, that Allah will not give them good in the hereafter. God's view is very different from human view. As explained in several authentic hadiths: \"God does not look at your appearance or your body, but God looks at your heart.\" (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) Allah knows better what is in their hearts, how pure their faith is, and how sincere they are in carrying out their obedience to Allah and His Messenger, unlike the views of those who accuse the believers of having wrong views. petty who believes anything. In fact, if the Prophet had a different opinion from them, it was because the Prophet did not only look at what appeared from the outside, but looked at the faith and sincerity of his followers. If the Prophet judged like the assessment of the disbelievers, surely he would be among the wrongdoers."

There is not a single animal that crawls over this universe that is not controlled by Him, and Allah is Most Just to guide His servants on the straight path, helping those who are righteous, and oppressing those who are unjust. Thus, Hud's answer to his people who dared to challenge it, was not driven by pride, arrogance and so on, but was driven by faith that had become steel in his heart to be accountable for the truth of his preaching delivered to his people. Hud as sure that the disbelievers from his people will not be able to do anything outside of the provisions and will of Allah. So trust arises in accordance with God's advice, as stated in His word:"

Indeed, Allah is the Preserver of all things carefully, in accordance with His sunnah which is determined by His iradah, among others helping His messengers and inflicting doom on their enemies. Hud's assertion to his people that they will not be able to cause harm to Allah, due to their turning away from faith and remaining in disbelief, is not just a warning to frighten them, but that is the essence and reality, and this is in accordance with Allah's word: If you disbelieve (know) then surely Allah does not need you and He is not pleased with the disbelief of His servants. If you are grateful, He accepts your gratitude. (az-Zumar\/39: 7) And the word of Allah: So worship besides Him as you please! (O polytheists).

There are those who receive grace, taufik, and guidance from Allah, they unite and promote unity, and they are included in the group of happy people who will become residents of heaven. There are also those who constantly argue and they are among the wretched people who become the inhabitants of hell. Malik bin Anas once said, \"Man was created partly in heaven and some others are in hell.\" Therefore Allah ends this verse with a firm statement that it has become His provision to fill Hell with jinns and humans who always do evil and sin on this earth."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the stories of the previous apostles and their people, such as the incidents of debate and enmity between them, the complaints of the prophets because their people belied and hurt and so on, all of this is useful to strengthen the heart of the Prophet so that he will not be swayed by anything to carry out his apostolic duties and broadcast his preaching. In addition, these stories also instill a solid and deep belief in what the apostles called for, such as the belief that Allah is One, repent and worship Him sincerely, leaving evil, both real and unreal. All of this is a useful lesson and warning for believers that the former ummah will be punished for them because they have done mischief and damage to the earth."

We will also act according to our position and ability to defend da'wah.\" and carry on the commands of Allah, and obey and obey Him.\" This is a threat to them about the punishment they will receive in return for their actions."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to tell the disbelievers who remained disobedient to the Apostle so that they would wait for what would happen with the Prophet's preaching, and what calamity befell the Apostle, which they really hoped for, as explained in His word. : In fact they say, \"He is a poet we were waiting for an accident to happen to him.\" (ath-thur\/52: 30) Then the Apostle was ordered to tell them that he was also waiting for what would happen to their fate, whether they would be punished by Allah, or would they be defeated by the believers, in the war that would take place between both sides, as the fate of the previous peoples, who disobeyed their prophets. Indeed, Allah guarantees victory for those who defend religion, and defeat and humiliation for those who do wrong. These verses are similar to the word of Allah: Later you will know, who will get the (best) place in the hereafter (later). Indeed, those who do wrong will not be successful. (al-Anam\/6: 135)"

He knows everything that will happen and the exact time it will happen. All matters will return to Him. What He wills will come to pass, and what He does not will will not exist. Therefore, He is the only one who deserves and must be worshiped, with all sincerity. It is in Him that we must put our trust in order to achieve something that is beyond our ability, because whoever puts his trust in Him will achieve his needs. Allah's Word: And whoever puts his trust in Allah, Allah will fulfill his (needs). Verily, Allah carries out His affairs. Indeed, Allah has made provision for everything. (ath-thalaq\/65: 3) At the end of this verse, Allah SWT explains that He will not be heedless of what His servants have done. He will complete every charity reward that is done in this world and there will be no reduction in the slightest. Allah's Word: And fear the day (when) you are all returned to Allah. Then everyone is given a perfect reward according to what he has done, and they are not wronged (harmed). (al-Baqarah\/2: 281)"
