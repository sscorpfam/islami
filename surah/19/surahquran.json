One of the most prominent traits is keeping promises. Keeping promises is a trait possessed by every apostle and prophet, but this trait in Ismail was so prominent that God made this trait as Ismail's specialty. Among the promises he kept even though the promise endangered his life was his willingness to be slaughtered as a sacrifice to carry out God's command to his father Abraham which he received through the intercession of ar-ruyah ash-sadiqah (true dreams) which is equivalent to revelation. When Ibrahim talked with Ismail about God's command to slaughter him, Ismail emphatically stated that he was willing to be slaughtered for the sake of obeying God's command and he would be steadfast and patient in facing death no matter how painful and painful it was. This is stated in the verse: So when the child reached (the age of) being able to try with him, (Ibrahim) said, \"O my son! I actually dreamed that I was slaughtering you. So think about what you think!\" He (Ismail) replied, \"O my father! Do what (Allah) commands you; God willing, you will find me among those who are patient.\" (ash-shaffat\/37: 102) That was Ismail's promise to his father Ibrahim. Ismail actually kept this promise and he gave himself to his father who was ready with a sharp knife to slaughter him. Ibrahim even though with a feeling of great compassion and pity laid Ismail down to make it easier to slaughter and a knife was pointed at his neck. At that time Allah called Ibrahim and replaced Ishmael with a big fat sheep. This is told by Allah in His word: So when both of them had surrendered and he (Ibrahim) laid his son on (his) cheek, (to carry out Allah's command). Then We called him, \"O Ibrahim! Indeed, you have justified the dream.\" Indeed, thus We reward those who do good. In fact, this is really a real test. And We ransomed the child with a large sacrifice. (ash-shaffat\/37: 103-107) In addition to this prominent characteristic, Ismail was appointed by Allah to be a prophet and messenger to the Jurhum tribe who settled in Mecca with his mother. As an apostle, Ismail was commissioned by Allah to convey the treatise, namely the treatise that had been delivered by his father the Prophet Abraham to the Jurhum tribe. Indeed, before the Prophet Muhammad was sent as an apostle, there were among the Arabs people who adhered to monotheism and most likely the monotheism that they adhered to was the ideology that Ismail brought and conveyed to his people."

At first, the Prophet Muhammad himself was only ordered to convey Islamic teachings to his family and then was ordered to invite all people to follow the teachings he brought. This is contained in the word of Allah: And warn your closest relatives (Muhammad), (asy- Syu'ara'\/26: 214) And His words: And order your family to pray and be patient in doing it.

In a hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allah said: Indeed, Allah loves a servant of His. He called the Angel Gabriel then He said to him, \"Indeed I love so and so you should love him too.\" Then call (it) in the sky then fall on him compassion on earth. (Al-Bukhari, Muslim and at-Tirmidhi) Regarding this verse Ibn Mardawaih and ad-Dailami narrated from al-Bara' he said that the Messenger of Allah said to Ali Karramallahu wajhah: Say, \"O Allah, give me Your promise (so that I be saved in the hereafter) and instill in the hearts of those who believe love for me.\" Then come down this verse. (History of Ibn Mardawaih and ad-Dailami) Indeed, if we pay attention to human life in society, the truth of this verse will be proven. Every person who truly believes, is truly sincere in his good deeds, really works for the benefit of his people without expecting money, rank or position, and only hopes for Divine pleasure, surely that person is loved by his people even though he himself does not try to do good. that direction. If someone hates or is angry with him, surely the angry person is someone who has bad intentions, has no noble character and is tempted by the tricks of Satan and the Devil."
