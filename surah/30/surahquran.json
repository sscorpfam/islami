			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the Romans were defeated by the Persians in a land close to Mecca, namely Syria. A few years later after they were defeated, the Romans would defeat the Persians in revenge for that defeat. The Romans referred to in this verse are the Eastern Roman Empire centered in Constantinople, not the Western Roman Empire centered in Rome. The Western Roman Empire, long before the events described in this verse took place, had been destroyed, namely in 476 AD. The Romans were Christians (People of the Book), while the Persians were Zoroastrians (polytheists). This verse is part of the verses that proclaim supernatural things that show the miracles of the Qur'an. When the Romans were defeated by the Persians, this verse was revealed which explains that at this time the Romans were defeated, but this defeat would not last long. In just a few years, the Persians must have been defeated by the Romans. The defeat of the Romans occurred before the Prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina. Hearing this news, the polytheists of Mecca rejoiced, while the believers and the Prophet grieved. As it is known that the Persians are Zoroastrians who worship fire, so they associate partners with God. The Meccans also associated partners with God by worshiping idols. Therefore, they feel their religion is close to that of the Persians, because they both associate partners with God. Muslims feel that their religion is close to Christianity, because they both adhere to the Samawi religion. Therefore, the polytheists of Mecca rejoiced at this victory, as a victory for the polytheistic religion which believed in \"many Gods\", over the Samawi religion which adhered to monotheism. On the other hand, the Muslims at that time grieved because their attitude against the polytheists of Mecca was increasing. They ridiculed the Muslims by saying that in the near future they too would be destroyed, as was the destruction of the Romans who embraced Christianity. Then this verse comes down to explain that the defeated Romans will defeat the Persians in a short time, only in a few years. History records that in 622 AD, that is, after seven or eight years of the defeat of the Romans against the Persians, the war between the two nations raged again for the second time. At the beginning of the war, there were signs of victory for the Romans. Even so, when the news of the war reached the polytheists of Mecca, they still hoped that victory would be on the Persian side. Therefore, when Ubay bin Khalaf learned that Abu Bakr had moved to Medina, he asked Abu Bakr's son, 'Abdurrahman, to guarantee his father's bet if the Persians won. This was accepted by 'Abdurrahman. In 624 AD, the Uhud war took place. When Ubay bin Khalaf was about to go out to fight the Muslims, 'Abdurrahman forbade him, unless his son guaranteed to pay the bet, if the Romans won. So Abdullah bin Ubay accepted to guarantee it. If you look at the news above, there are several possibilities as follows: first, in 622 AD, the war between the Romans and the Persians ended with the victory of the Romans. However, because of the difficult relationship at that time, the news only reached Mecca a year later, so Ubay asked for a guarantee when Abu Bakar moved, whereas 'Abdurrahman asked for a guarantee when Ubay would go to the Uhud War. Second, the war lasted from 622-624 AD, and ended with the victory of the Romans. From the events above, several things and lessons can be put forward that need to be contemplated and practiced. First: There is a relationship between polytheism and disbelief in da'wah and faith in Allah. Even though the countries in the past did not have a sophisticated communication system and their nations did not have the strong relations they have today, nevertheless the nations already have an inner relationship, that is, between nations that adhere to religions originating from God on the one hand, and nations that adhere to religions that do not originate from God on the other hand. The polytheists of Mecca considered the victory of the Persians over the Romans (Christians), as their victory too because they both adhered to polytheism. Meanwhile, the Muslims felt that the defeat of the Romans who were Christians was also their defeat, because they felt that their religion came from a single source. This is a real factor that Muslims need to pay attention to in developing tactics and strategies in preaching. Second: Absolute trust in God's promises and decrees. This can be seen in the words of Abu Bakr who was full of confidence without hesitation when setting the bet amount with Ubay bin Khalaf. The price of one hundred camels was very high at that time, so that if it were not for the belief in the truth of the verses of the Qur'an that was in the heart of Abu Bakr, surely he would not have dared to make such a large bet, especially if you read the history of the Romans in the time of defeat was in a state of topsy-turvy. It is very difficult to predict that they will be able to defeat the Persians, who are in a strong condition, only in the next three to nine years. A strong belief like that of Abu Bakr is the belief of the Muslims, which cannot be shaken by anything, even in the form of torture, trials, suffering, boycotts, and so on. This is the main capital for Muslims to face jihad which will require a long time in the future. If the Muslims had faith and tried like the Muslims at the time of the Prophet, surely Allah would bring victory to them. Third: The occurrence of an event is God's business, no one can interfere with it. It is Allah who determines everything according to His wisdom and wisdom. This means that Muslims must return all matters to Allah alone, both in events like the one above, as well as in events and events that are a balance between situations and circumstances. Victory and defeat, progress and decline of a nation, as well as the weaknesses and strengths that occur on this earth, all return to God. He does according to His will. Everything that happens is based on the will of the absolute Substance. So surrendering and accepting all that Allah has ordained is a characteristic that a believer must possess. This does not mean that human effort is not worth anything, for it is a condition for the success of any work. In a hadith it is narrated that a Bedouin Arab released his camel at the door of the Prophet's mosque, then he entered it saying, \"I put my trust in Allah,\" then the Prophet said: Tie the camel after that then you put your trust. (History of at-Tirmidhi from Anas bin Malik) Based on this hadith, a Muslim is told to try his best, then he surrenders to Allah about the results of his efforts. The end of this verse explains that the Muslims rejoiced when they heard the news of the victory of the Romans over the Persians. They are happy because: 1. They have been able to prove to the polytheists of Mecca the truth of the news contained in the verses of the Qur'an. 2. The victory of the Romans over the Persians was the victory of the Divine religion over the human-created religion. 3. The victory of the Romans over the Persians foreshadowed the victory of the Muslims over the Meccan infidels in the not too distant future."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that Allah helps and wins whoever He wills, punishes those who should be punished by destroying them. Allah also helps those who uphold His religion, and bestows mercy on His creatures. God does not allow strong people to do as they please, thus oppressing weak people. However, God did not immediately punish the people who sinned. He said: And if Allah were to punish people for what they have done, He would not have spared a single living moving creature on this earth, but He has suspended (punishment) for it, until the appointed time. Later when their death comes, Allah is All-Seeing (the condition of) His servants. (Fathir\/35: 45) (6) This verse explains that Allah has fulfilled His promise by winning the Romans over the Persians. Allah never denies His promises which come from His will and from His wisdom and wisdom. No one can change and hinder the fulfillment of that promise and there is no event in this nature that is carried out outside of His will. The fulfillment of that promise is His sunnah which never changes in the slightest, unless He wills it. However, most people don't know this because they don't think about it. Or they know the truth of the promise, but because of the influence of lust, they don't seem to believe it. The meaning of the words \"most people\" in this verse are polytheists and other misguided people who do not believe in sunatullah. There are more of them than people know. They do not want to believe in the verses of the Qur'an revealed to them and do not believe in the attributes of Allah's perfection and power."

They only look at life's problems pragmatically, that is, according to the uses and benefits that emerge. They know about this life only on appearances, such as farming, trading, working, and those related to world affairs. Their knowledge does not even get to the heart of the matter, so they are deceived by their knowledge. Because they do not live and know the true knowledge, the polytheists, misguided people, and liars are negligent about the afterlife and the real life. Their negligence in preparing themselves to face the hereafter causes them to no longer be able to judge things correctly, both against their desires, and against the events and events they experience. The attention to the day of reckoning in the hereafter in the human heart will change his view and evaluation of everything that happens in this world. They believe that living in this world is a short journey from a long journey of life. However, this short journey will determine a long life in the hereafter. Does man want to destroy a long life in the hereafter by destroying a short life in this world? In this regard, humans who believe in the existence of an afterlife with precise and critical calculations find it difficult to find common ground with people who only live for this world. Between one another there will be differences in assessing an issue. Each of them has their own considerations and glasses in seeing natural objects, situations and events that are being faced, issues of life and death, the past and the present, the human and animal worlds, the supernatural and the real, the physical and the spiritual. etc."

They actually always travel to trade from Mecca to Syria and southern Arabia from other countries around the Arabian Peninsula. On that journey, they passed through countries that were destroyed by Allah, because their inhabitants denied the messengers who had been sent to them, such as the lands of 'Ad, Samud, Madyan, and so on. The people of ancient times had a high level of civilization, more powerful and stronger than the polytheists of Quraysh. Those ancient peoples were able to cultivate and prosper the earth, better than they did. However, these people denied and belied the apostles sent by God to them, so that they were destroyed by God with various calamities such as lightning strikes, powerful earthquakes, strong winds, and so on. Such is the sunnah of Allah that applies to those who deny His religion and that sunnah will also apply to everyone who denies the apostles, including the Quraysh themselves who deny the apostleship of Muhammad. Even though Allah has decreed this, the polytheists do not heed and think about it. This verse is a warning to all human beings wherever and whenever they are, so that they know and experience the essence of life and life, and know God's purpose in creating human beings. Humans were created by Allah with the same purpose, since ancient times, now, and also in the future, namely as vicegerents of Allah on earth and worshiping Him. Those whose life goals are not in accordance with those outlined by Allah, it means that they have deviated from that goal and their lives will not be pleased by Allah.

(Yunus\/10: 18) Those polytheists in the hereafter deny the idols they worship in the world, even though it is with these idols that they associate partners with the Lord of the Worlds in the world."

There they were entertained with all kinds of entertainment that God had provided, such as melodious songs that had never been heard by humans. From a hadith narrated by Abu Darda' it is stated that Rasulullah once explained about the pleasures in heaven. Then a Bedouin asked, \"O Messenger of Allah, is there any singing in heaven?\" The Prophet replied, \"That's right, O Bedouins, in fact, in heaven there is a river full of virgins. They sing things that have never been heard by creatures in the world. That is the best of heaven's blessings.\" Zamakhsyari also narrates that in heaven there are wooden trees where silver bells hang. If the inhabitants of heaven want to listen to his singing, then Allah sends a wind from under the throne, then the wind passes through the tree and moves the bells so that a melodious sound is heard. If that voice were heard by the inhabitants of the world, they would surely die of joy."

Allah ordered them to purify Him of all qualities that are not worthy of Him, praise and adore Him and mention His name with all the good and praiseworthy qualities. It's as if Allah said, \"If you already know with certainty the fate of the two groups, then purify me at night and during the day, in the evening and in the morning with various practices that are pleasing to Him.\" Ibn 'Abbas is of the opinion that what is meant by tasbih (purifying God) here is the five daily prayers required of Muslims. Then people ask, \"From what words do you understand the five daily prayers?\" Ibn 'Abbas replied, \"From the words \"then glorify Allah when you are at night\", the meaning is the Maghrib and Isha prayers. The words \"and when you are at dawn\", mean the Fajr prayer. you are in the evening\", the meaning is the Asr prayer, and the words \"and when you are at the noon time\", namely the Zuhr prayer. Ibn 'Abbas, Adh-ahhak, Sa'id bin Jabair, and Qatadah argue that the two verses The above is only a sign of the four prayers, namely the Maghrib, Fajr, Asr, and Zuhur prayers, while the Isya prayer (the last one) is mentioned in another verse, namely Allah's word: Carry out the prayer from the time the sun drops until the night is dark and (also perform the prayer) Dawn. Indeed, the dawn prayer is witnessed (by angels). (al-Isra'\/17: 78) An-Nahhas, an expert in commentary, also argues that the verses mentioned above relate to the five daily prayers. He supports the opinion ' Ali bin Sulaiman said that the verse is glorifying Allah in prayer, because the tasbih is present in these prayers. Imam ar-Razi is of the opinion that the tasbih means \"purification\". This opinion is stronger and more important, because purification includes prayer. The purification that is commanded is: 1. Purification of the heart, that is, a firm intention. 2. Purification of the tongue and heart, that is, to say good things. 3. Purification of the limbs along with the heart and tongue, namely doing good deeds (good deeds). The first purification above is the substance, the second is the result of the first, and the third is the result of the second. Because a human being who has good intentions that arise from his heart, is reflected in his good words. When he says the truth of his words will be clearly seen in his behavior and all his actions. The tongue is the translator of what is in the heart. While the actions of the limbs are the embodiment of what is in the heart and what has been said verbally. Prayer is the best act of the limbs, including mentioning God with the mouth and intentions with the heart, and that is the real cleansing. If Allah says to purify Him, then the Muslims are obliged to do whatever is deemed appropriate to purify Him. The order to purify Allah is an order to pray. This opinion is in accordance with the tafsir of ayat 15 above. Because Allah explains that the highest position and the most perfect reward will be obtained by those who believe and do good deeds. Allah says: So as for those who believe and do good deeds, then they will be happy in the Garden (Paradise). (ar-Rum\/30: 15) In this verse, Allah states that when it is known that heaven is a place for people who do good deeds, then purify Allah with good faith in the heart, exalt Him with the tongue, and do good deeds with using body parts. All of that is purification and praise. Give praise to Allah so that the joy in heaven and the desired pleasure can be achieved. This verse also explains that not only are humans the only creatures who glorify Allah, but all creatures in the heavens and on earth also glorify and praise Him. This is clearly seen from the following verse: The seven heavens, the earth and everything in them glorify Allah. And there is nothing but glorify Him by praising Him, but you do not understand their tasbih. Indeed, He is Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving. (al-Isra'\/17: 44) Allah explained that their tasbih to Him was for their own benefit, not for Allah. Therefore, they are obliged to praise Allah by glorifying Him. This has been said by Allah as mentioned in the following verse: They feel they have served you with their Islam. Say, \"Do not feel you have merited me with your Islam, in fact Allah is the one who bestows favors on you by showing you to faith, if you are a righteous person.\" (al-hujarat\/49: 17) There are commentators who argue that the purpose of praising Allah is a way to glorify Allah and encourage people to worship Him, because His blessings are very much given to humans. In these two verses, it is prioritized to mention the proper times to glorify because the signs of Allah's power, majesty, and grace appear at these times. The mention of night takes precedence over morning because according to the Qamariah calendar, night and darkness precede morning. The beginning of the date begins after sunset. This is also the case with evening and noon, that is, evening earlier than noon according to the Qamariah calendar. There are several hadiths that say about the advantages contained in these two verses. The first is: The Messenger of Allah has said, \"Would you like me to tell you: \"Why did Allah name Ibrahim as His faithful khalil (friend)? That is because he reads in the morning and evening, glorify Allah when you are in the evening at dawn. And to Him belongs all the praise in the heavens and the earth and when you are in the evening and when you are at noon.\" (History of Ahmad and Ibn Jarir from Mu'adz bin Anas) in the morning subhanallah until the word of God wa kadzalika tukhrajun then he will get a reward for what he cannot do during the day. And whoever says in the evening, he will get a reward for what he cannot do at night. (History of Abu Dawud and ath-thabrani from Ibn 'Abbas) From the two hadiths above, it can be concluded how important verses 17-18 above are for Muslims to live and practice."

			"tafsir": "This verse reveals some of the power of Allah, who calls on His servants to glorify and worship Him. People who glorify Allah without knowing the rights, powers, and greatness of Allah in worship, then the tasbih and worship will not be of any benefit. He will not meet Allah with tasbih and worship like that, even though what is expected is an encounter that will broaden the chest, open the heart, and purify the soul. Therefore, the worship that is ordered is worship that can really make an impression on the human soul. In this regard, this verse instructs us to pay attention to the condition of this nature, because in it there are signs of Allah's power and greatness. It can be noticed that this life comes from inanimate matter, and inanimate matter comes from life. This can be seen in eggs and chickens. The egg is inanimate, but it can bring out a live chicken. Similarly, a chicken is a living thing, but it can lay an egg which is an inanimate object. Mujahid, an interpreter, interprets this verse as a parable between believers and infidels. According to him, \"the coming out of the living from the dead\" and \"the dead from the living\" meant both believers and unbelievers. There are children of believers who become disbelievers, on the other hand there are children of unbelievers who become believers. There are also those who interpret that this life ends with death and that death ends with life again in the afterlife. Because these two things, namely death and life are routine circumstances in life in this world, it is not impossible for Allah to raise humans from their graves on the Day of Resurrection. Humans must pay attention to this. As another example that is closer to humans is the state of land that is already barren and arid. This land will return to fertility and can grow plants, if Allah sends down rain from the sky. After paying attention to the examples above, the question addressed to disbelievers is whether Allah's unlimited power is not enough to bring man back to life from death, where his bones have been scattered, and his flesh has united with the ground. ? Of course you can. Therefore, when the trumpet is blown by an angel, people will rise and all will go to Padang Mahsyar to face God. Allah says: And Allah causes you to grow from the ground, grow (gradually), then He will return you to it (the land) and bring you out (on the Day of Resurrection) with certainty. (an-Nuh\/71: 17-18) Why do people deny the resurrection day? Why are they arguing about it? In fact, God's power is unnecessary and cannot be denied. Who is wise will not be able to deny that power. However, he runs away from responsibility to face reckoning on the Day of Judgment. He wanted to release his soul from the feeling of faith with his heart, according to his destiny in this world. He did not prepare anything for the afterlife. Thus man is deceived by his soul and passions. He neglects his true calling, and follows what suits his passions."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that there are signs of Allah's greatness in man himself. Humans were created from the ground, while the land is an inanimate object that does not move. In connection with the incident of man from the ground, Rasulullah saw said as follows: Indeed, Allah has made Adam from a lump of soil that He took from all kinds of soil. Then came the children of Adam according to their land of origin. They have white, red, black, and so on; some are ugly, good, simple, sad, and so on. (History of Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi from Abu Musa al-Asy'ari) The Qur'an explains a lot about the origin of human events. In surahh al-Mu'minun, for example, Allah says: And indeed, We have created man from the essence (derived) from the ground. (al-Mu'minun\/23: 12) In surahh al-Mu'minun above, it is explained that human events originate from the essence of the soil. This is an incident that is not directly from humans. However, in verse 20 it is stated that the origin of the incident was directly from the ground and immediately followed by the image of people moving and scattering. This is to compare the process and meaning of dead and immovable land with living and moving humans, according to God's word in the previous verse, \"He brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living.\" It was an extraordinary event and a sign of God's power. It also indicates that there is a strong connection between humans and the earth as their place of life, and a meeting place with the origin of that incident. Humans and the earth in this universe are subject to the laws of Allah that apply to them. The process of moving from an immovable and meaningless earthly form to a mobile and noble human form is a transfer that contains an element of resurrection in God's creation. This moves the feelings to give thanks and tasbih to Him, and moves the heart to glorify the Most Glorious Creator. The Qur'an stipulates this fact so that humans pay attention to Allah's creation, and think about the process of moving from land to being human. In terms of human events, the Qur'an does not detail the process of human growth and development from soil to being human, because the Qur'an is a book of guidance and does not fully contain knowledge so it only contains hints. Meanwhile, scientists have tried to establish various theories for human growth, to link the chain of events. Scientific theories may be right or they may be wrong. What is true now may be undone in the future, as modern technology advances to investigate a problem. It is necessary to understand that science and the Qur'an both come from God, so there will be no contradictions. If at any time the theory of science is wrong, then the fault lies with humans. While the statement of the Qur'an remains true. There is a crossroads between the view of the Qur'an on human beings and the views of these scientific theories. The Qur'an glorifies man and stipulates that in him there is the breath of the spirit created by Allah. God created them from the ground into humans, and gave them features that distinguished them from animals. Such a view is simply not found in scientific theories, which are based solely on matter, and have nothing to do with God at all. How Allah emphasizes the importance of the role of land in the creation of creatures as well as humans, is not only stated in the verse above, but also in surahh al-Hijr\/15: 26, 28, 33 and several other verses, including: He created you from earth, after that He determines death, and there is another death appointed with Him, then you are still in doubt. (al-An'am\/6: 2) He has created man from dry earth like pottery, and He has created the jinn from pure flames. So which of the favors of your Lord do you both deny? (ar-Rahman\/55: 14) According to science, two important components that must exist in the beginning of life are genetic material and cell membranes. These two materials work together to support life. In both, the clay material is predominant. This is proven by conducting research on clay soil called \"montmorilenite clay\". Research has found that this type of clay can stimulate the rapid formation of a membrane fluid-filled sac. Research also proves that the liquid in the membrane sac also contains clay material. It turns out that this sac can grow by means of simple division. This mode of division is a description of what happened to the primitive cell. From this explanation, we can say that the information in the Qur'an about the origin of human origins from the ground is true and has been proven by scientific research."

			"tafsir": "In the following verse, the signs of Allah's power are explained, namely the life together between a man and a woman in a marriage. Humans know that they have certain feelings towards other types. These feelings and thoughts are caused by the attraction that exists in each of them, which makes one attracted to the other, so that between the two sexes, men and women, a natural relationship is established. They step forward and try to achieve feelings and tendencies between men and women. The culmination of all this is the occurrence of marriage between men and women. In such circumstances, for men only his wife is the best woman, while for women only her husband is the man who attracts her. Each felt at ease with the presence of the partner. All of these are the most valuable capital in building a happy household. With a happy home, the soul and mind will be peaceful, their bodies and hearts will be calm, life and livelihood will be steady, the excitement of life will arise, and peace for men and women as a whole will be achieved. It was He who created you from one soul (Adam) and from it He created his partner, so that he would be pleased with him. So after mixing with him, (his wife) conceived a light womb, and he continued to feel light (some time). Then when he feels heavy, both (husband and wife) pray to Allah, their Lord (while saying), \"If You give us pious children, surely we will always be grateful.\" (al-A'raf\/7: 189) Specifically regarding the words mawaddah (love) and rahmah (affection), Mujahid and 'Ikrimah argue that the first is a substitute for the word \"marriage\" (having intercourse) and the second is pronoun \"child\". So according to Mujahid and 'Ikrimah, the meaning of the verse \"that He made between husband and wife a feeling of affection\" is that there is a marriage as prescribed by God between a man and a woman of his own kind, namely the human kind, intercourse will occur which will cause having children and offspring. Intercourse is something that is normal in human life, just as children are something that is also common. Some argue that mawaddah is for young people, and mercy is for parents. There are also those who interpret that mawaddah is a feeling of affection that gets stronger and stronger between husband and wife. In connection with this mawaddah, Allah cursed Lut's people for giving vent to their lust by having homosexuality, and leaving their wives who should have been the place where they bestowed affection and had intercourse. Allah said: And you left (women) that God created to be your wives? (asy-Syu'ara'\/26: 166) In this verse, Allah informs men that a \"certain place\" belongs to women and is made for men. In the hadith it is explained that wives should serve their husbands' invitations, whenever he wants, but they have to look at each other's conditions, both from a health and emotional point of view. Thus, there will be harmony in the household. The Prophet said: By God, in whose hands my soul is, no man invites his wife to mix, but he (the wife) is reluctant, unless those in heaven will be angry with the wife, until her husband is pleased with her. In another pronunciation, this hadith reads, \"When a wife sleeps and leaves her husband's bed, the angels will curse her until she is up in the morning. (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) In this verse and other verses, Allah sets out provisions- provisions of husband and wife's life to achieve happiness in life, peace of mind, and harmony in household life. If this has not been achieved, they should conduct introspection on themselves, examine what they have not been able to do and the mistakes they have made. Then they determine the best way to make peace and fulfill these deficiencies in accordance with Allah's provisions, so that the expected goals of marriage are achieved, namely peace, mutual love and affection. it closes by stating that these are signs of power n and the greatness of Allah for those who want to use their minds. However, very few humans want to remember the power of Allah who created partners for them from their own kind (human kind) and instilled love and affection in their souls. A scientific study showed that after examining thousands of married couples, it was concluded that after a correlation was held, there were many similarities between the two couples, both psychologically and physically. The meaning of \"your own kind\" here is from the same psychological and physical side so that they have something in common between the two. Only by living with a partner who feels familiar (familiar) with him, feelings of mawaddah and mercy, compassion and feelings of love will grow. Therefore, a marriage partner must be selected from the same type, physical group, and psychology that have a similar resemblance to him."

The number of people who know the secret of what happened is very few. Very few know that there are countless galaxies*) in the sky. Each of these galaxies has millions of stars, planets, satellites and other celestial bodies. The earth inhabited by humans is like a very small atom that has almost no weight and shadow, when compared to all these galaxies. In fact, there are many galaxies in space, and each of these galaxies is a very orderly circulation system. . Everything goes according to predetermined rules. That is in terms of numbers and systems. As for the secrets of these great natural objects, their properties, what is hidden and what is visible in them, the natural laws that guard, regulate, and run them, these things are very many in variety and variety compared to what is already known to humans. What humans already know is only a small part, even though experts have investigated the state of the universe for many years. They know that all this has been going on for millions of years according to the laws of nature and in a very orderly manner. After mentioning the greatness of Allah through the creation of the heavens and the earth, the verse above states the diversity of languages and skin colors. Here Allah states that He in essence made human beings to consist of many races that have the same position in His eyes. Talking about race, Allah explains it through the tongue or orally. In this case, the word tongue has two meanings. First, the tongue is physically in the oral cavity and plays a very important role in making sounds. This sound is the basis for the emergence of language for communication purposes. Second, the tongue is a language itself. According to scientists, the tongue is an organ located in the oral cavity. This organ is a muscular structure consisting of seventeen muscles that have several functions. The tongue, among other things, functions to help regulate sounds for communicating or speaking. Another function is to help swallow food and taste buds. It is estimated that there are about 10,000 taste buds on the tongue. These points are very active to always renew themselves. The tongue can taste a variety of tastes. The tongue, in the field of religion, is almost always associated with the heart, and is used to measure the merits of one's behavior. Speaking is a very complex activity. It starts with a feeling that pushes to say a point. Then move the lips, tongue, jaw, and other speech aids, which after going through a complicated process, the sounds they emit are understood by their speech partners. In the next stage, a language will be created. Language is thought to have been used by humans around 45,000 years before Christ. The number of languages in the world is believed to hover around 6,000. The secrets of the events of the heavens and the earth, differences in language and skin color, and human psychological characteristics will not be known, except by people who have knowledge. Therefore, this verse closes with \"indeed, in that there are signs for people who know (knowledge).\""

			"tafsir": "This verse still talks about the signs of Allah's power and greatness, the universe and its relation to human condition, the change of day and night, as well as human sleep at night and waking up to seek sustenance during the day. Humans sleep at night so that their body can get calm and rest, to recover the energy used when they wake up. Sleeping and waking up alternates in human life, just like the alternation of day and night in this universe. With these alternating circumstances, humans will know God's favor and His goodness. At bedtime humans rest their bodies. He will get the movement of his limbs freely when awake. In this verse, sleeping takes precedence over getting up, even though waking up seems more important than sleeping because when people wake up they work, try, and carry out their duties and obligations in life, as contained in His words, \"and your efforts seek some of His gifts. In general, humans pay very little attention to the pleasures of sleep. Most of them view sleep as an unimportant matter. This is a misunderstanding in understanding the great blessings that God has bestowed on humans. Sleep is human alienation from the busyness of life, and disconnection the relationship between the soul and its own substance, as if its identity had disappeared at that time. When sleeping or in a state between waking and sleeping, humans go wherever they like with their minds and spirits. He can travel the world to the back of the material world which has no shackles and hindrances.There he can realize the unrealizable in this world of all things. In that dreamland he will find satisfaction. How many people are poor, but in their dreams they can eat what they want. How many people have been persecuted, but in his dream he can heal his soul from violence and tyranny. How many people live far apart, but in their dreams they can meet to their heart's content. There are many other examples that cannot be mentioned one by one. According to psychologists, dreams experienced during sleep are neutralizers, namely purifiers and antidotes for the soul. For people who are hungry, for example, they can make what they want or fantasize about when they wake up. Likewise with people who are persecuted, thirsty, and so on. With that situation the soul will be relieved and at ease. Otherwise, there will certainly be very dangerous mental tensions. So in the world of sleep, humans will get satisfaction in their mind, spirit and soul. Which things cannot be obtained when awake or awake. If the human body needs to eat and drink, then the spirit, soul and mind also need to eat and drink. Both of these things he did at bedtime. Sleep is nothing but shackles for the body, but freedom for the soul. Thus, the psychological aspect gets its happiness at bedtime, and is free from material things, pressure, and tyranny. Otherwise, the spirit will always be trapped in the body and its light will fade. People who regard sleep as a trifling matter, a grave and necessary necessity for the human body, as well as a drug that grips the personality, as in childhood and old age, think that way because they know nothing but what can be felt by the hand, or seen by the eye itself. As for what's behind it, they don't know or believe in it, or because they are materialistic, who only look at material things. They associate with humans only on material grounds. If sleep is considered a real pleasure, then indeed Allah has provided the night as the right time for him. Sleep is a clear blessing, as in the word of Allah: Say (Muhammad), \"What do you think, if Allah made for you the day continuously until the Day of Resurrection. Who is the god other than Allah who will bring you the night as a time of rest? Have you not noticed ?\" (al-Qashash\/28: 72) That night was like a screen that covered living things including humans. Then he led them to tranquility, then sleep. In fact, night is something that cannot be avoided, just like day. Night is time for rest and day is time for work. As for those who work at night, they are still required to maintain the rights of their bodies in the sense of resting them. Allah says: And it is He who lulls you to sleep at night and He knows what you do during the day. Then He wakes you up at noon to complete your appointed age. Then to Him will you return, then He will tell you what you have done. (al-Anam\/6: 60) Since the night is an important and proper time for sleeping, Allah swears many words in the Qur'an by night, such as surahh al-Lail (Night), as a tribute to the time of night. In this surah there is a hint that when night comes, the light of day is closed, and there is darkness and silence that is uniform. Such a time is perfect for sleep and rest of body and soul. When noon comes, then nature is bright and such a time is perfect for working, trying, and struggling. Allah says: By the night when it covers (the light of day), by the day when it is bright. (al-Lail\/92: 1-2) In another verse Allah says: By the sun and its light in the morning, by the moon when it accompanies it, by the day when it is revealed, by the night when it is covered (darkness). (asy-Shams\/91: 1-4) In verse 23, day is equated with night, that is, with His words, \"¦sleep at night and during the day.\" This is an affirmation that even though night is the right time to sleep, it does not prohibit people from using the time of day to sleep. In general, humans sleep at night, but not a few of them sleep during the day, or some of their sleep takes place during the day. Therefore, the night comes first. This verse closes with the phrase, \"Indeed, in that there are signs for people who listen.\" In this expression the appeal is addressed to the hearing, not the other five senses. This is a sign that hearing embodies knowledge, and also gives an understanding that sleeping at night and during the day, and trying to seek God's grace are some of the signs of His power and greatness. Only people who have sharp and sensitive hearing can pay attention to what they hear, especially the verses of the Qur'an that are recited to them."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains another sign of Allah's power and greatness, namely lightning. This is a natural phenomenon (symptom) that can be witnessed by the five senses and can also be explained scientifically. Lightning arises from electrical sparks that occur when the positive electricity that is in a group of clouds containing water combines with the negative electricity that is on earth, when the two are close together, for example when the cloud is at the top of a mountain. From the union of the two types of electricity comes an emptying of air which causes lightning, followed by lightning and rain. So lightning is a natural phenomenon (symptom) that arises from the rules created by God to govern this nature. Al-Qur'an in accordance with its situation as a book of da'wah, does not specify the nature of these natural phenomena, and does not explain their causes. The Qur'an only mentions it as a tool to connect the human heart with nature and its Creator. Therefore, in this verse he establishes one of the signs of Allah's existence, namely by showing a state of lightning that creates fear and hope. These two instinctive feelings come and go to the human soul in dealing with this phenomenon. The feeling of fear arises when you see lightning because it is followed by lightning which, if it strikes something, will destroy it. If a human is struck by it, he will burn to death. When metal (metal) is struck, then the object will melt and melt. When rocks and buildings are struck, they will be destroyed. After the words fear and hope, this verse continues with \"He sent down water (rain) from the sky, then with that water revived the earth after it died (dry).\" The expression of life and death when connected with land is an expression that describes that land can live and can also die. That is the nature described in the Qur'an. This nature is a living creature, which is submissive and obedient to Allah, carrying out His commands by glorifying and worshiping Him. Humans who live on earth are one of God's creatures. They and these creatures are in a big parade facing Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Besides that, when water waters the soil, it will fertilize it. Then the plants grow and the leaves develop. So it is with animals and humans. Water is the messenger and carrier of life. Where there is water there is life. Indeed, in that there are indeed signs of Allah's power for people who use their minds. This verse ends with the word \"reason\", as a medium for thinking and investigating."

The establishment of the heavens and the earth by Allah's will means that their existence is under His care and arrangement. By Allah's iradat (bi amrihi) here the meaning is His power and ability. If someone thinks that this universe, both the heavens and the earth, has existed in such a way according to their nature, without being cared for by God, what is their opinion about the natural order which is very harmonious, so that one with the other, never collide. Some people deny that nature was created by Allah and is under His care because they do not want to acknowledge His oneness. The heavens and the earth will remain in their present state until a predetermined moment comes, namely the Doomsday. When that time comes, humans will fulfill God's call to rise from the grave. When the day of resurrection will come no one knows. One thing that is clear is that the call for the resurrection came after all humans died. The expression \"immediately you came out (from the grave)\", shows that the resurrection from the grave was immediately after the call, not too late even for a moment. God's word in another verse: Then the trumpet was blown, so immediately they came out of their graves (alive), heading to their Lord. (Yasin\/36: 51) The words \"immediately\" or the words \"suddenly\" in verse 25 are addressed to those who do not want the day of resurrection, and do not believe in the afterlife. Therefore, it is understandable that when they are resurrected on the Day of Judgment, they will be astonished and amazed. Then they said as narrated in the Qur'an: They said, \"Woe to us! Who raised us from our bed (grave)?\" This is what the Most Merciful (Allah) promised and true the messengers (His). (Yasin\/36: 52)"

This verse stipulates that whoever owns all the heavens and the earth, He is the one who started the incident, and He will also return it after death to its original state. In verse 11 above, it has been mentioned about the beginning of human occurrence and its return to life after death. This is repeated here again to strengthen this statement after the proof of Allah's greatness has been explained above. Here is added the statement that it is easier for Him to revive it. In this verse there are the words \"easier\" that is, bringing life is easier for Allah than its original creation. However, it is easier to revive than to create all that is by comparing it to the habits that apply to humans, not to be linked to God, because for God everything is easy. Allah will not feel heavy doing anything. Allah said: Surely it is His business when He wills something He only says to it, \"Be it!\" Then be that something. (Yasin\/36: 82) For humans, creating something is more difficult than repeating all efforts, sincerity, and so on. In that effort, they make mistakes over and over again, just to get to what is meant. After arriving at what he aspired to, of course repeating it made it easier for him, it didn't require as much effort as when starting it, because everything had been imagined in his mind how to make it. As for Allah, nothing is easier or more difficult. Everything is easy for Him. Allah swt said, \"The children of Adam have lied to me and reproached me, even though the lies and reproaches never existed. As for their lies against me, they said, 'Allah cannot restore me as He created me. And there is no beginning of creation that is easier for me than returning it. As for their reproach against me, they say, 'Allah took (had) a child. And I am one, dependent on everything, I did not give birth and I was not born, nor is there anyone equal to Me.\" (Al-Bukhari's history from Abu Hurairah) The words \"easier\" are also commented with the sentence \"He has the most high nature in the heavens and the earth.\" Allah is one in all heavens and earth with all His attributes, there is nothing associated with Him. There is nothing like Him. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Wise. The word \"mighty\" here means \"one who overcomes, or can do what he wills.\" \"Wise\" means controlling all beings with precision and within limits."

Thus, they can take a lesson from the parable, and evaluate God with all the attributes of perfection that are suitable for Him. This verse describes a parable for people who worship several other gods besides Allah. They even prioritized loyalty to the gods in themselves. In the parable, the polytheists of Mecca are told to pay attention to themselves and their position and the slaves they have. As masters or masters, would they surrender to the slaves all that they owned, and share in the affairs of the goods and pleasures which God had bestowed upon them. Thus, the slaves became their rivals and allies in control of these goods and pleasures. Could slave owners accept the stipulation that for their slaves there was power over what they owned, so that they could not do anything to their property until they had the pleasure and consent of their slaves? This of course they will not be able to accept. If this is acceptable, it means that they no longer have full control over their property. This problem occurs between two kinds of Allah's creatures, namely masters or masters and their slaves in managing and enjoying the sustenance, wealth and favors that He has bestowed upon them. The masters did not want to give in the slightest to their slaves in controlling their property. Allah, as the owner of everything, Almighty, Almighty, will not want polytheists to associate with the creatures He created in the form of statues, just as they themselves would not want to associate with their slaves in managing and controlling their property. Everyone who uses reason and common sense will understand the parable. The actions of the polytheists are an insult to Allah. Do the polytheists stick to their position that with Allah there is a partner, while they hope for His mercy and are afraid of His punishment, after this clear explanation and very strong arguments? Some of them accepted the argument and some did not. Most of the polytheists have blind eyes and diseased souls so they do not see clear explanations and strong arguments.

Even they remain in error and polytheism. Their minds are mastered and controlled by lust. Such a person will never be controlled except by his desires. He will not answer anything except according to his devil's call. The statement about an act without knowledge in this verse is a sign that the lust that dominates the polytheists is a lust that is blind and cannot be penetrated by the light of truth. Sometimes people follow their desires. Then when given a warning and instructions, he will get up and follow the instructions. That was the condition of the polytheists who lived in the era of ignorance polytheism. They surrender to their passions. But when Islam came and the light of truth shone on them, they woke up from their sleep. They can see after being blind, and get guidance after going astray. This verse then ends with the explanation that those who have been led astray by Allah will not be guided forever. This explanation is a sign to the polytheists who are stubborn in polytheism that they are still in error. They will not move even one step away from that misguidance, because God left them in that state. Allah says: Whoever is allowed to go astray by Allah, then no one can guide him. God let him drift in error. (al-A'raf\/7: 186) The polytheists will not receive guidance, so they live in error and die in error. When Allah's promise comes, they stand to be judged and questioned.

In the sentence \"Then turn your face straight towards religion (Islam); (according to) Allah's fitrah\", there is Allah's command to the Prophet Muhammad to follow the straight religion, namely Islam, and follow Allah's fitrah. Some argue that this sentence means that Allah commands Muslims to follow Allah's religion which He has made for mankind. Here \"fitrah\" is defined as \"religion\" because humans are made to carry out that religion. This is confirmed by the word of Allah in another surahh: And I did not create the jinn and humans except that they would worship Me. (adz-dzariyat\/51: 56) Facing the face (face) means straightening the goal with all sincerity without turning to others. \"Face\" or \"face\" is specifically mentioned here because it is the gathering place for all the five senses, and the most honorable part of the body. In connection with the word fitrah mentioned in this verse there is an authentic hadith from Abu Hurairah which reads: There is no child unless he is born according to fitrah. It is the two parents who will Judaize, convert, or promote it, just as animals give birth to their children in perfect condition. Do you feel lacking in him. Then Abu Hurairah said, \"Read this verse which means: ¦ Allah's fitrah is because He has created humans according to that (fitrah). There is no change in Allah's creation.\" In another narration, \"So you destroy it (the animal).\" The friends asked, \"O Messenger of Allah, do you know the condition of people who died when they were small?\" The apostle replied, \"Allah knows best what they are doing.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Scholars differ on the meaning of fitrah. Some argue that fitrah means \"Islam\". This was said by Abu Hurairah, Ibn Shihab, and others. They say that this opinion is popular among the main salaf who adhere to takwil. Their reason is verse (30) and the hadith of Abu Hurairah above. They also argue with the hadith that Rasulullah SAW said to people one day: Would you like me to tell you what Allah has told me in His Book. Verily, Allah has created Adam and his descendants inclined to the truth and obedient to Allah. Allah gave them lawful wealth not unlawful. Then they make the property that was given to them become lawful and unlawful . . . \"(Ahmad's history from hammad) The above opinion is shared by most commentators. As for the meaning of the words of the Prophet, when he was asked about the condition of the children of the polytheists, he replied, \"Allah knows better what they know,\" that is, if they This tafsir is supported by the hadith of al-Bukhari from Samurah bin Jundub from the Prophet Muhammad. Part of the long hadith reads as follows: As for the tall person who is in heaven, it is Ibrahim as. As for the children around him, all of them is a child born according to fitrah. Samurah said, \"Then the Messenger of Allah was asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, about the children of polytheists? The Messenger of Allah replied, 'And the children of polytheists.\" (Al-Bukhari history from Samurah bin Jundub) Some other scholars interpret \"fitrah\" with \"events\" by which Allah makes children know their Lord. As if to say, \"Every child born because of what happened.\" With that incident, the child will know his God if he is wise and knowledgeable. The incident here is different from the incident of animals that do not come to the knowledge of their God. They argue that \"fitrah\" means \"event\" and \"fathir\". \" means \"who created\" with the word of Allah: Say, \"O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth.\" (az-Zumar\/39: 46) And there is no reason for me not to worship (Allah) who created me. (Yasin\/36 : 22) He (Ibrahim) replied, \"Actually your God is the Lord (owner) of the heavens and the earth; (He is) the one who created it.\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 56) Then the sentence in verse (30) is followed by the expression that there is no change in Allah's nature. Allah will not change His nature. There is nothing those who violate this rule mean that those whom Allah makes happy will not be miserable, and conversely those who are made miserable by Him will not be happy. According to Mujahid, this means that there is no change in Allah's religion. This opinion is supported by Qatadah, Ibnu Jubair, adh-ahhak, Ibn Zaid, and an-Nakha'i. They argue that the above expression is related to belief. 'Ikrimah narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that Umar bin Khaththab said, \"There is no change for Allah's creatures from spayed animals. \" This word means the prohibition of spaying animals. The expression \"that is the straight religion\", according to Ibn 'Abbas, means \"that is the right decision\". Muqatil said that that was the correct calculation or. Some say that the straight religion is Islam, but most people don't know. They don't want to think that Islam is the true religion. Therefore, they do not want to submit themselves to their Creator, and the previous God (qadim) decides things and carries out His decisions."

How does human action so that he does not change the religion of Islam is by way of repentance to Him. However, there are those who interpret the sentence \"returning to repent to Him\" as a description of the word \"turn your face\" mentioned above. The intention is that the Prophet Muhammad and his people straightened their faces (face faces) by returning to repentance to Allah. The Muslims are also included in this order because the messenger to the Prophet also means the messenger to his people. This verse also tells people to repent to God. This order is then connected with orders for people to fear Him, to establish prayers, and to prohibit being polytheists. Returning to Allah is a good way to correct this fitrah and stay away from all obstacles that might hinder it. The command to be pious takes precedence over the order to establish prayer because prayer is one of the main signs of a pious person. Prayers and other acts of worship will yield no results, except on the basis of faith in Allah, feeling His power and height. In this case Allah says: Really lucky are those who believe, (namely) people who are solemn in their prayers. (al-Mu'minun\/23: 1-2) Worship also means nothing if it is not accompanied by sincerity.

The expression that the tribulation only \"touched\" him meant that it was only light and momentary in his long lifetime, not until it \"hit\" him horribly. However, with just a touch of tribulation, they already felt that the world was dark. They immediately prayed to God to be released from the distress. They accompany this prayer by drawing closer to Allah. They worship diligently, ask forgiveness for their sins, and promise to obey God's commands in the future. Thus, they return to their nature. However, their obedience was only temporary, that is, as long as the distress was still felt. When the tribulation is replaced by Allah by \"tasting\" him a little happiness, some of them have forgotten themselves and returned to partners with Allah. Associating partners with Allah means believing that there are other elements that play a role in making them lucky or difficult, whether in the form of idols, demons, or humans. It's a big mistake if they see the profit of the business as the result of their own efforts and hard work, so they are not grateful for that blessing.

The shirk belief of the Quraysh infidels was not based on revelation and was not taught by a prophet from Allah. Means the belief is wrong. Thus, the expression in the form of a verse question once again means denial or rejection. It is expressed in this way so that it penetrates deep into the human heart.

Therefore, the belief in shirk will be strictly examined by Allah and its adherents will not escape His punishment, as stated in the following verse: And whoever worships a god other than Allah, even though there is no evidence for him about it, then his calculation is only to his God. Verily, those who disbelieve will not prosper. (al-Mu'minun\/23: 117) (36) The second behavior that can lead people to shirk is when they are given even a little mercy by Allah, they forget the land. However, if the slightest misfortune befalls them, they despair and renounce. In this verse, Allah also states \"tasted\" which means that only a little is given. These gifts include material possessions. Therefore, no matter how many treasures, it is nothing compared to the happiness that He will give in the hereafter. However, there are some people who are complacent with God's grace in that world, then forget the land. They deny Allah, and no longer care about all His commands and prohibitions. They are willing to sacrifice their eternal happiness in the hereafter for the insignificant and temporary pleasures of this world. As a result, they will be punished later in the afterlife. On the other hand, when they experience suffering caused by their own mistakes, they quickly become discouraged. This piece of verse indicates that the world is not always pleasant, but it will be interspersed with tribulations. Happiness and sorrow are indeed driven by God, as He says: ¦We will test you with bad and good as trials¦. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 35) Therefore, humans should not be easily complacent when receiving favors and should not quickly despair when experiencing difficulties. In this verse it is stated that they despair because of what their own hands have done. It means that they made that mistake on purpose. They should admit the mistake and quickly repent. But this is not so, they distance themselves from Allah and do not ask Him for help. Because they feel unable to face the difficulties, they are hopeless and pessimistic. Thus, they go against their nature, because people who stand on nature are those who always draw closer to Allah (see verse 31 above) and are always optimistic. This behavior is described in another verse: Indeed, humans are created to be complaining. When he is struck by trouble he complains, and when he gets good (wealth) he becomes stingy, except for those who pray. (al-Ma'arij\/70: 19-22) In these verses it is explained that the behavior of being impatient, restless, and miserly is the nature of some humans, not all of them. Those who are consistent in performing their prayers will not behave this way, because every time they communicate with Allah. Thus, they will not lose their minds when they get into trouble and will not lose heart when they receive favors. They are patient when they encounter difficulties, and are grateful when they obtain happiness, as stated in the following hadith: Strange is the condition of a believer, Allah will not make a decision unless it is good for him. If he is overtaken by joy he is grateful, that is good for him. If he is struck by misfortune he is patient, that is good for him. (History of Ahmad and Muslim from Suhaib)"

Because of the difference in positions, all jobs can be filled by humans according to their abilities. Allah said: Are they dividing the mercy of your Lord? It is We who determine their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others by several degrees, so that some of them can take advantage of some of the others. And the mercy of your Lord is better than what they collect. (az-Zukhruf\/43:32) That fact for those who believe gives a lesson that Allah exists and is All-Powerful and All-Wise. Both the spaciousness and the limited provision of both are a test from Allah, can those who are given sustenance use them according to what Allah wills, and can those whose sustenance is limited realize their limitations. In addition, God's blessings are not only material, but also non-material, such as health, peace of life, good name, and so on. It often happens that Allah bestows material blessings on someone, but limits non-material blessings. On the other hand, Allah often limits material blessings to a person, but pours out His non-material blessings. It shows that Allah is Almighty and All-Wise, so people should have faith in Him."

			"tafsir": "This verse is an explanation of verse 37, namely that those to whom Allah has given excess sustenance must help those who are lacking. The assistance is in the form of material assistance outside of zakat. Those who are prioritized to be assisted are their own immediate family. The assistance in this verse is even stated as his right. In another verse it is stated that if we cannot help, then this needs to be conveyed honestly with words that are pleasant to accept so that they are soothing: And if you turn away from them to get the grace from your Lord that you hope for, then say weak words to them gentle. (al-Isra'\/17:28) The people who need help are the poor, namely people who are unable to meet their basic needs. Thus, Allah does not want any of His creatures to starve, let alone die from hunger. If that happens, then those who have excess sustenance will sin. Indeed one can feel how painful hunger is and one can understand how dangerous hunger is. Furthermore, those who need help are stranded travelers, at least for one day. With help after help, he would be able to reach his original place. Returning the traveler immediately to his place of origin would be of great benefit, for he would be able to work again as before. Leaving him stranded in an unfamiliar place would result in all kinds of trouble in that place. Such is the obligation of a believer. He is aware that the assets he has are only entrusted to be managed properly. The owner of the property is Allah, so when the owner asks to be removed part of it to help others, then he will not refuse it. Allah says: Have faith in Allah and His Messenger and spend (in the way of Allah) some of the wealth that He has made you his ruler (trust). So those who believe among you and spend (their wealth in the way of Allah) will receive a great reward. (al-hadid\/57: 7) A believer will not see that the wealth he has is solely due to his own efforts. All the good fortune that man gets is a gift from Allah, as stated in the Qur'an about Prophet Sulayman: One who has knowledge from the Book said, \"I will bring the throne to you before your eyes blink.\" So when he (Sulaiman) saw that the throne was located in front of him, he said, \"This is a gift from my Lord to test me, whether I am grateful or deny (His favor). Whoever is grateful, he is actually grateful for his own (good) , and whoever disbelieves, then surely my Lord is Rich, Most Glorious.\" (an-Naml\/27: 40) The attitude that denies God's grace in every fortune is the attitude of Karun, a wealthy but rebellious person at the time of Prophet Musa as. As a result, he and his wealth were swallowed up by the earth. Allah said: He (Karun) said, \"Indeed I was given (the treasure), solely because of the knowledge that is in me.\" Did he not know that Allah had destroyed previous generations who were stronger than him and amassed more wealth? And those who sin do not need to be asked about their sins. (al-Qashash\/28: 78) Helping close families, the poor, and stranded travelers will have a good impact on those who give and those who are given. The person who gives means that he has fulfilled God's commands, so that he will be loved by Him. While the person who is given it will feel helped, and because of that friendship will be established between families who are well off and those who are lacking. The impact is security and close brotherhood. Such an impact will be obtained if the one who gives is only expecting the pleasure of Allah. Thus, the meaning of this verse is that the giver gives not to expect a return from the one given, but a reward from Allah when he meets Him later in the hereafter. That is, he gave sincerely. Believers are prohibited from giving because of joy, that is to be seen by people or to show off. One form of joy is giving but the gift is mentioned to other people so that it drops the name given, or hurts the heart of the person given by conveying words or actions that hurt his feelings. Allah said: O you who believe! Do not spoil your alms by mentioning it and hurting (the recipient's feelings), like a person who spends his wealth to show off to humans and he does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example (of that person) is like a smooth stone on which there is dust, then heavy rain falls on the stone, so it remains smooth again. They don't gain anything from what they do. And Allah does not guide the disbelievers. (al-Baqarah\/2: 264)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that usury is intended as a gift or giving to gain more. Riba is the return of more than debt. The excess is sometimes intended as a gift, with the hope that the gift will develop in the hands of the person who owes it, then that person will return to the person who paid the debt with more than what was presented to him. Such usury was often practiced in the days of ignorance. In this verse it is emphasized that such business behavior does not receive blessings from Allah. He does not get a reward from Him because the gift is not sincere. Therefore, the scholars view this verse as the first verse in the stage of prohibiting usury until it is strictly prohibited. (The second stage is in surahh an-Nisa'\/4: 161, which contains a hint about the prohibition of usury; the third stage is ali 'Imran\/3: 130, that what is forbidden is only multiple usury; the fourth stage is al-Baqarah\/ 2: 278, which forbids usury in any form). There are also those who understand this verse regarding giving to someone for the purpose of getting more in return. The extra replies include debt repayments. That is what is called usury in the verse above, and many scholars allow it based on the hadith: Rasulullah SAW received a gift and rewarded him for that gift. He gave a reward for the gift of a dairy camel given to him, and he did not deny its owner when he asked for something in return. He only denied the anger of giving the gift because the revenge was worth more than the value of the gift. (Al-Bukhari's history from 'Aisyah) However, based on this hadith, what is really justified is repaying with more than one gift, not paying a debt more than it should. Giving with the intention of getting more in return than what is given shows the insincerity of the one who gives. This is also not allowed. Allah's Word: And do not you (Muhammad) give (with the intention) to get (return) more. (al-Muddassir\/74: 6) One form of giving that is intended to get more in return is giving with the intention that the person obeys the giver, wants to help him, and so on. That is also not justified, because it is not sincere. Outwardly, the prohibition in the verse is addressed to the Prophet. However, it is also intended for all his people. As for that which will be multiplied by Allah both the reward and the treasure itself is a sincere gift, which in this verse is expressed by the term zakat (literally means holy). Zakat here means charity which is sunnah, not zakat which is obligatory. People who give charity because they expect a reward from Allah, will surely be multiplied by Allah's reward or reward at least seven hundred times, as He said in al-Baqarah \/ 2: 261: The parable of a person who spends his wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed that grows seven stalks, on each stalk there are a hundred seeds. Allah multiplies for whom He wills, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing. (al-Baqarah\/2: 261) In addition, charity will also multiply the wealth of the owner of the capital, because it strengthens the purchasing power of society at large. Strong public purchasing power will demand increased production. An increase in production will require an increase in production institutions (factories, companies, and so on). The addition of production institutions will open up employment so that by itself it will demand an increase in the workforce. The addition of labor will increase people's income thereby increasing their purchasing power, and so on. Thus there is a cycle of increasing purchasing power, production, labor, and so on, so that an economy based on broad community empowerment will always increase economic progress. Meanwhile, an economy based on usury, namely the return of more than debt, always contains exploitation, which will gradually set the economy back."

If in the previous verses it was about the determination of sustenance, in the following verses it is about the journey of human life. The goal is so that humans want to do good, including giving charity as God commanded in the previous verse. In this verse it is stated that Allah created humans from nothing to exist, then appeared in this world. To be able to live in the world, He is also the one who gives them sustenance. After that, humans will die and will be revived. The return of life has begun in the grave (barzakh realm) until the Day of Judgment. After the Apocalypse, humans will be revived forever. How the condition of life after death is very dependent on human actions in the world. If his actions are good, he will be happy, and if his deeds are bad, he will be tortured. Therefore, humans should comply with God's provisions regarding the sustenance that He gives. He should get it properly according to Allah's provisions, not from usury. If the fortune is more, it should be used to help people who are lacking. Then Allah asked if there were other gods capable of such things. Let alone creating complex humans, creating even simple creatures out of nothing at all, humans would not be able to. Can humans create just a grain of sand, or a leaf from nothing? Therefore, Allah confirms, \"Glory to Him and Most High from all associations, partners, or any match and anyone.\" Thus, humans should stop believing in other than Allah or associating partners with Him."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that al-fasad has occurred on land and sea. Al-Fasad is any form of violation of the system or law made by Allah, which is translated as \"destruction\". The destruction can be in the form of natural pollution so that it is no longer suitable for habitation, or even destruction of nature so that it can no longer be used. On land, for example, the destruction of flora and fauna, and in the sea such as damage to marine life. Also included in al-fasad is robbery, piracy, murder, rebellion, and so on. The destruction occurs as a result of human behavior, for example excessive exploitation of nature, war, weapons trials, and so on. This behavior is impossible for a believer with true faith because he knows that all his actions will be accounted for later in front of Allah. In this verse, Allah emphasizes that not all of the bad effects of destroying nature are felt by humans, but only some of them. Some other bad consequences have been overcome by Allah, including by providing a system in nature that can neutralize or restore natural damage. This means that God loves humans. If Allah did not love humans, and did not provide a natural system to repair their damage, then surely humans would feel all the consequences of their evil deeds. This entire nature will be destroyed and humans will no longer be able to inhabit and utilize it, so they too will be destroyed. Allah said: And if Allah were to punish people for what they have done, He would not have spared a single living moving creature on this earth, but He has postponed (punishment) it, until the appointed time. Later when their death comes, Allah is All-Seeing (the condition of) His servants. (al-Fathir\/35: 45) By inflicting on them some of the consequences of the destruction of nature that they did, Allah hopes that people will be aware. They no longer destroy nature, but maintain it. They no longer violate the ecosystem that God created, but obey it. They also no longer deny and associate partners with Allah, but believe in Him. Indeed polytheism is an act of sin that is extraordinarily large and has a great impact, so it is very difficult for the perpetrators to be held accountable. It is even hard to be carried by nature, as stated in His words: The heavens were almost split open, and the earth was split open, and the mountains collapsed, (because of that speech). (Maryam\/19: 90) The entire heavens and earth are a unified system under the command of Allah. As mentioned in the Qur'an that everything in this system is given for the benefit of human life, which is followed by a spiritual warning not to associate Him with others. As a caliph, humans must follow and comply with all of Allah's laws, including not doing damage to existing natural resources. They must also be responsible for the sustainability of life on this earth. The earth was subdued by God to become a human habitation. However, instead of being grateful, humans are the creatures that do the most damage to the balance of nature. Examples of natural events that occur in Indonesia due to human activities are forest fires and floods. By appointing humans as caliphs, besides obtaining the right to use what is on earth, they also bear a heavy responsibility in managing it. From this, it can be seen that the Islamic view that the earth is meant for humans. However, humans should not treat the earth at will. This is indicated by the words earth (453 times) being mentioned more frequently in the Quran than heaven or heaven (320 times). This gives a strong impression of the goodness and holiness of the earth. Dust can replace water in washing. The Prophet Muhammad said: The earth was created for me as a mosque and as a tool for purification. (History of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah from Abu Hurairah) There is a kind of sacredness and holiness of the earth, so it is a good place to worship God, both in formal ceremonies and in everyday life."

The order also applies to anyone after them until the end of time. If they have doubts about the truth of Islam, let them witness the ruins with their own eyes or examine their historical remains.

The meaning of \"straight religion\" here is Islam because this religion carries teachings that are straight and will definitely lead to happiness in this world and in the hereafter. The command to face the intention is to carry out the teachings completely. The mention of the face in this verse is because it is the identity of a person. Directing the face means facing all human aspects, namely the body, spirit, and mind. Facing the face of a straight religion means carrying out religious orders with all totality. The implementation of these teachings must be as soon as possible so that society will be better, safer, and develop. Those who are guilty must immediately come to their senses and repent. That's because the age of humans and nature is limited. If death comes for someone or Doomsday occurs for mankind, then no one can refuse it, as Allah says: And every nation has a time limit. When the end came, they could not ask for a moment's delay or acceleration. (al-A'raf\/7: 34) At the end of this verse it is described that on the day of resurrection, when all are resurrected, all human beings are in an uproar and run aimlessly. Each of them is busy with his own problems, as the following verses describe: On that day a man will flee from his brother, and from his mother and father, and from his wife and children. Every one of them that day had some business to occupy him with. ('Abasa\/80: 34-37) Humans are only guided by their deeds.

Therefore, the heaven received by humans who do good is a gift from God, not a reward for their deeds. Thus, the acquisition of heaven is because Allah loves those who believe, and does not love unbelievers. The expressions in this verse are indeed very concise, but comprehensive. Brief because the opposite expression of what is conveyed is not stated. This verse simply reveals that, \"Allah rewards those who believe and do good\" and, \"He does not love those who disbelieve\". These two expressions contain two other expressions which mean the opposite, namely, \"He punishes those who disbelieve and do evil\" and \"He loves those who believe and do good.\" The opposite expression does not need to be stated because it can be understood from the first expression.

The wind is a precursor or a sign of the coming rain. That's because the wind forms clouds. When the clouds get denser and cooler, they turn into water droplets, then fall as rain. Thus, the wind brings good news to humans, namely the possibility of rain. With that rain, Allah wants to feel His mercy to humans. Rain provides water which is the source of life for plants, animals and humans themselves. It is an adage in science that where there is water there is life, and no water means there is no life. Because there is water, plants and animals \"which are the staple food of humans\" can live. Because there is water, agriculture and animal husbandry can also be developed. Therefore, humans need to maintain water sources and manage rainwater properly so that it does not waste into the sea. Another use of the wind mentioned in this verse is for shipping. In the era of sailing ships to the era of engine ships and even to the era of nuclear-powered ships now, weather and wind are still the determining or influential factors in the success of sailing. The wind blows by Allah's command, in the sense that it is based on the laws that He has determined. Therefore, humans need to develop the science of meteorology which studies wind, weather, and so on so that sailing is smooth and advanced. A further use of the wind is to seek God's grace. Therefore, it is necessary to develop various wind utilization technologies in addition to agriculture, animal husbandry and shipping. Currently, what is being developed by humans is to use wind as an energy source, for example for generating electricity, driving machines, and so on. Therefore, the science of meteorology needs to be strengthened so that it is beneficial for agriculture, animal husbandry, shipping, energy, industry and other economic activities. With the development of economic activity, welfare will increase. The existence of the wind and its laws created by Allah for human welfare, should be grateful. They should acknowledge the existence of Allah, have faith in Him, acknowledge that sustenance is His gift, use the sustenance according to His will, and be obedient in worshiping and worshiping Him. If man is grateful, then it is for himself, as stated in the following verse: And indeed, We have given wisdom to Lukman, namely, \"Be grateful to Allah! And whoever gives thanks (to Allah), then he is actually grateful for himself; And whoever is not grateful (kufr), then surely Allah is Rich, Most Praised.\" (Luqman\/31: 12) For those who are grateful for His blessings, Allah will increase His blessings on them, as stated in the following verse: And (remember) when your Lord declared, \"If you are grateful, I will increase (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then surely My punishment will be very severe.\" (Ibrahim\/14: 7)"

According to scientists, the occurrence of rain is a cycle. Therefore, it doesn't matter where the explanation begins. The water that flows along the tributaries that will join with other tributaries to form a much larger river. The river finally flows into the sea. While water flows through streams and rivers, some of it evaporates in the heat of the sun (turns into gas) but most of it continues to flow down to the sea. It is in this sea that the next process of evaporation or evaporation takes place. All water that evaporates, whether it comes from streams, rivers or the sea, forms water vapor in the atmosphere. This vapor rises and cools as it reaches the higher atmosphere. If there is a lot of gas in the atmosphere, it will condense into the clouds we can see. If the cloud reaches even higher in the atmosphere, the water vapor turns into ice drops. When clouds cross a plateau or when it gets colder due to lower atmospheric temperatures, the water condenses and falls. At first the water is still like very small drops of water, then it usually melts before it reaches the ground, then falls to the earth as rain.

(al-An'am\/6: 28) They have actually been given enough opportunities in this world to do what they should, but they are negligent, tempted by Satan, and do evil. They admit that as described in the following verse: And (remember) on the day (when) Allah gathered them, (they felt) as if they had never stayed (in the world) except for a moment during the day, (when) they got to know each other. It is a loss for those who deny their meeting with Allah and they are not guided. (Yunus\/10: 45) Therefore, the short time to live in the world in the feelings of unbelievers is just a made-up excuse. Actually they are afraid of going to hell, so they are looking for various kinds of tricks or tricks."

			"tafsir": "The unbeliever's feeling that their life in this world is very short is not true. It is their attempt to lie before Allah. Their lies were denied by those who were gifted with knowledge and faith. Those who are gifted with knowledge are those who understand the essence of truth, then they believe and prove their faith with good deeds so that they truly feel what they believe in in their hearts. Those who are gifted with faith are those who have obtained the essence of truth so that they believe in Allah and everything that is revealed in the Qur'an. They also carry out all the revelations to prepare themselves for the resurrection day. Those who have been given knowledge and faith fill their lives with good deeds in preparation for the resurrection day. Hence, they did not feel that their lifetime in the world was short, but sufficient. Those disbelievers feel that their life is short because they are heedless in the world. They think that life in this world will not continue with the hereafter, and do not realize that they must be held accountable for all their actions."

			"tafsir": "On the day of resurrection man is brought before the judgment of God. At that time, an infidel will not be allowed to give any reasons, for example feeling that his life in this world is too short and asking to be returned to the world just for a moment so he can do good. They will also not be given the opportunity to have their sentences changed. In another verse Allah says: And (how terrible), if you saw those who sinned bowed their heads before their Lord, (they said), \"O our Lord, we have seen and heard, then return us (to the world) ), surely we will do good deeds. Indeed, we are people who believe.\" And if We will, We will surely give guidance to every soul (for it), but My words (statute) have been determined, \"I will certainly fill Hell with the jinn and humans together.

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is stated that Allah has conveyed various explanations regarding the evidence that He exists and is Almighty. Among them is how the previous peoples and their civilizations were destroyed because they violated Allah's provisions, how He sent down rain which greatly affected fertility and prosperity, and how He determined the journey of human life to death and to be resurrected in the afterlife. All of this shows Allah Almighty, and at the same time shows that there is a return to life in the hereafter. However, those who do not want to believe deny all of this as a sign of Allah's existence and His omnipotence. They even accuse the believer of conveying untruths and committing lies."

			"tafsir": "The disbelievers' rejection of every explanation from Allah conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad is because their hearts have been closed by Allah. The closing of the heart occurs because they themselves always close it to every verse or truth conveyed to them, finally the heart is completely closed. They don't want to understand and they don't want to understand the essence of the truth that is conveyed to them and they are arrogant, and in the end they disbelieve."

This is because Allah's promise is true, the hereafter will definitely exist, and those who disbelieve and shirk will surely be put into hell. Therefore, the Prophet and the Muslims should not be confused and agitated by the denial and denial of these disbelievers. The Prophet was asked to be steadfast and not stop from preaching and implementing the truth of the Qur'an."
