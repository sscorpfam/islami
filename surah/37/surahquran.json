			"tafsir": "In the Qur'an there are many swear words, which are intended to strengthen the impression given in the verses. The words that are used for swearing must be words that have important meanings that show His greatness and power, for example: \"by the sun\", \"by the night\", and so on. In this verse, Allah says, \"By (the company of angels) marching in rows.\" The intention is for the sake of the angels marching in straight and orderly rows, in performing worship and other tasks commanded by Allah. This means that the angels are always disciplined, orderly, and neat in carrying out their duties from God. The Messenger of Allah said: The Messenger of Allah said, \" Why don't you line up like the angels march before Allah?\" We asked, \"How are the angels lined up before God?\" The Prophet replied, \"The angels perfected the front row and then tightened it and tidied it up.\" (History of Abu Dawud., Ibn Majah, and Ahmad from Jabir bin Samurah)"

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah swears by mentioning the angels who are rebuked to forbid such creatures from committing immoral acts. Angels are God's creatures who are very obedient and obedient to His commands and prohibitions. Therefore, they are not happy to see other creatures who commit disobedience, violate Allah's prohibitions, and do not do what He commands. They rebuked him like a shepherd rebuking his cattle."

So in this verse Allah confirms that He is the Lord who created and sustains all the heavens and the earth, and everything that is between them. He also rules over all corners of nature, including the places where the sun rises every day of the year. This all shows His power and majesty, as well as the beauty of all His creation that no one else can imitate."

He protects humans from the temptations of Satan who always persuades humans to commit disobedience, which will lead to destruction and His wrath. For this reason, Allah has provided guidance, in the form of the true religion, which will protect humans from the temptations of Satan. Only humans who disbelieve can be subdued by the devil's harmful seductions."

Allah commanded His apostles to ask them questions, intended as a rebuke to their stubbornness. In fact, they themselves admit that the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all that is great in them is more difficult than creating humans. So how can they deny the resurrection, when they witness something more difficult than what they deny it. Allah's Word: And isn't (God) who created the heavens and the earth, able to re-create the like (their bodies that were destroyed)? True, and He is the Creator, the All-Knowing. (Yasin\/36: 81) In another verse Allah says: Indeed, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of human beings, but most people do not know. (al-Mu'min\/40: 57) To explain this comparison Allah provides an additional explanation by mentioning the incident of their ancestor, namely Adam from clay. The process of Adam's incident showed them the simplicity of his creation when compared to the creation of this gigantic universe. When Allah has the power to create this world, surely it is even more powerful to revive Adam's children and grandchildren on the Day of Judgment. The Messenger of Allah then warned Allah not to expect too much of the faith of those who are stubborn. There is no benefit for them with all the information and warnings because they are not interested. Even the disbelievers made fun of the Prophet, so that the Prophet himself was amazed. In fact their hearts were closed, and their souls could not reach such a belief. They are no longer able to see the explanations and signs that could indicate the resurrection from the grave. Even their arrogance and defiance had reached a peak. They made fun of what the Prophet Muhammad had said, and belittled his sincerity so that they would believe in the day of resurrection."

Likewise, those who do good will be rewarded according to their kindness."

The Prophet Muhammad never uttered imaginary sentences as a poet, but in fact he was the bearer and supporter of truth. There is no need to doubt the monotheism teachings that he propagated, because the oneness of God is confirmed by a sound mind and can be proven with real arguments. It is not proper if the Apostle is called a poet even though he brought true teachings. The same teachings have also been brought before by previous prophets. The teachings of monotheism that he brought continued the teachings of monotheism brought by the prophets in the past, and were not once made by Muhammad saw. So accusations against the Apostle of being a poet and a madman are only out of hatred and sheer denial. Allah will surely inflict a grievous doom and severe punishment on the disbelievers who accuse the Prophet of being insulted. The punishment for those who disobey the teachings of the apostles can be felt in this world, before being felt in the hereafter. Like the doom suffered by the Samud, Pharaoh and others. But God will not bring down punishment on humans except only as a reward and a result of their own actions. Allah says: Whoever does good then (the reward) is for himself and whoever does evil then (his sin) becomes his own responsibility. And your Lord is not unjust at all (His) servants.

			"tafsir": "Then Ibrahim raised his eyes to the stars by thinking deeply about how to deal with his people who still insisted on worshiping statues, only with the excuse of preserving the heritage of their ancestors. In fact, he had warned and taught them, as Allah says: (Remember), when he (Ibrahim) said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues that you diligently worship?\" They replied, \"We found our ancestors worshiping him.\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 52-53) After serious thought and consideration, he decided to take a dangerous action, which was to destroy all the idols. At one point, the Abrahamic people came to invite him to attend their big day. He refused their invitation subtly on the grounds that his health was disturbed. Apart from avoiding being present on their big day, Prophet Ibrahim intended to carry out his plan to destroy the statues, and expressed open opposition to the worshipers of the statues. His people did not know about Prophet Ibrahim's plan and did not suspect him either. Nor did it appear in his demeanor that he was not being truthful in his words. Thus, their big day ceremony took place without Ibrahim present. The reason for his health problems for not attending the invitation of his people, when in fact he is not sick, is not considered a lie which is forbidden in religion. That Ibrahim lied to his people is true. The Messenger of Allah said: Prophet Ibrahim did not lie except for three words, two of which were about Allah's substance, namely his words \"I am sick\" and \"actually this big one broke it\", and his words regarding his wife Sarah \"this is my sister\". (History of A.hmad and asy-Syaikhan from Abu Hurairah) The words of Prophet Ibrahim that his health was disturbed which were spoken in front of his people were actually to avoid his presence at the big day ceremony of his people. Ibrahim said, \"Surely we and my fathers are in a clear error.\" They replied, \"Did you come to us seriously or were you one of those who were playing games?\" Ibrahim said, \"Actually your God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth that He has created and I am among those who can provide evidence for that. By Allah, I will actually trick your idols after you leave them.\" During the celebration of the big day, Prophet Ibrahim used the opportunity to destroy the statues of his people. Ibrahim's words that it was the largest statue that broke it, were spoken when he was questioned by his people about the matter of destroying the statue. Actually he himself broke the statue, but it is said that the biggest statue broke it, even though his people realized that the statues could not do anything. Ibrahim's two words were uttered in the framework of his struggle to uphold the sentence of monotheism.

			"tafsir": "Then Ibrahim raised his eyes to the stars by thinking deeply about how to deal with his people who still insisted on worshiping statues, only with the excuse of preserving the heritage of their ancestors. In fact, he had warned and taught them, as Allah says: (Remember), when he (Ibrahim) said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues that you diligently worship?\" They replied, \"We found our ancestors worshiping him.\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 52-53) After serious thought and consideration, he decided to take a dangerous action, which was to destroy all the idols. At one point, the Abrahamic people came to invite him to attend their big day. He refused their invitation subtly on the grounds that his health was disturbed. Apart from avoiding being present on their big day, Prophet Ibrahim intended to carry out his plan to destroy the statues, and expressed open opposition to the worshipers of the statues. His people did not know about Prophet Ibrahim's plan and did not suspect him either. Nor did it appear in his demeanor that he was not being truthful in his words. Thus, their big day ceremony took place without Ibrahim present. The reason for his health problems for not attending the invitation of his people, when in fact he is not sick, is not considered a lie which is forbidden in religion. That Ibrahim lied to his people is true. The Messenger of Allah said: Prophet Ibrahim did not lie except for three words, two of which were about Allah's substance, namely his words \"I am sick\" and \"actually this big one broke it\", and his words regarding his wife Sarah \"this is my sister\". (History of A.hmad and asy-Syaikhan from Abu Hurairah) The words of Prophet Ibrahim that his health was disturbed which were spoken in front of his people were actually to avoid his presence at the big day ceremony of his people. Ibrahim said, \"Surely we and my fathers are in a clear error.\" They replied, \"Did you come to us seriously or were you one of those who were playing games?\" Ibrahim said, \"Actually your God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth that He has created and I am among those who can provide evidence for that. By Allah, I will actually trick your idols after you leave them.\" During the celebration of the big day, Prophet Ibrahim used the opportunity to destroy the statues of his people. Ibrahim's words that it was the largest statue that broke it, were spoken when he was questioned by his people about the matter of destroying the statue. Actually he himself broke the statue, but it is said that the biggest statue broke it, even though his people realized that the statues could not do anything. Ibrahim's two words were uttered in the framework of his struggle to uphold the sentence of monotheism. As for the third sentence, namely \"Sarah is my sister\" when in fact his wife, was uttered before the king when the king wanted Sarah. Thus, the three words uttered by Ibrahim are not lies that are reprehensible in the eyes of religion and society.

At that time, Ismail was approaching puberty or adolescence, an age when children can help their parents with their work. According to al-Farra', Ismail was 13 years old at that time. Ibrahim with a sad heart told Ismail about God's command that was conveyed to him through a dream. He asked his son's opinion regarding the order. God's command regarding the self-sacrifice of their own children, which is a great trial for parents and children. After listening to God's command, Ishmael with all humility told his father to do everything he was told. He will obey, willingly, and sincerely accept God's provisions and uphold all His commandments and surrender to Him. Ismail who was still very young told his parents that he would not be daunted by this trial, would not hesitate to accept God's qada and qadar. He will patiently and patiently endure the slaughter. Ismail's attitude was highly praised by Allah in His word: And tell (Muhammad), the story of Ismail in the Book (Al-Qur'an). He is truly a true promise, an apostle and prophet. (Maryam\/19: 54)"

It is indeed Allah's right to test the servant He wants with the form of test He chooses in the form of heavy burdens and obligations. When the test has been set, no one can resist or avoid it. Behind these ordeals, of course, there are wisdom and secrets that cannot be reached by the human mind. Ismail, who was originally used as a sacrifice to test Abraham's obedience, was replaced by Allah with a large, clean white lamb without any blemishes. This incident of slaughtering a goat by the Prophet Abraham became the basis for the sacrifice to get closer to Allah, followed by the Prophet Muhammad's shari'a. This sacrificial service is carried out on the hajj\/sacrificial feast or on tasyriq days, which are three consecutive days after the qurbani feast, the 11th, 12th, 13th of Zulhijah. Sacrificial animals consist of livestock such as camels, cows, buffaloes, and goats. It is hinted that the sacrificial animal is not handicapped, not sick, and is old enough. Slaughtering animals for this sacrifice is the law of sunnah muakkadah (emphasized sunnah). Allah's Word: So pray for your Lord, and make sacrifices (as worship and draw closer to Allah). (al-Kautsar\/108: 2) With the ritual of sacrificial worship in Islam, the incident of Abraham slaughtering his son will be remembered forever and followed by his people. The sacrificial service also enlivens the Islamic religion because the meat of the sacrifice is distributed to the community, especially to the poor."

Sacrificial animals consist of livestock such as camels, cows, buffaloes, and goats. It is hinted that the sacrificial animal is not handicapped, not sick, and is old enough. Slaughtering animals for this sacrifice is the law of sunnah muakkadah (emphasized sunnah). Allah's Word: So pray for your Lord, and make sacrifices (as worship and draw closer to Allah). (al-Kautsar\/108: 2) With the ritual of sacrificial worship in Islam, the incident of Abraham slaughtering his son will be remembered forever and followed by his people. The sacrificial service also enlivens the Islamic religion because the meat of the sacrifice is distributed to the community, especially to the poor."

			"surah": 37,
			"ayat": 112,
			"tafsir": "This verse explains that Allah has conveyed the good news to Abraham about the birth of a son from his first wife, Sarah. This news was delivered by an angel, disguised as a human, when visiting his house even though Sarah was old at that time. Allah's Word: So he (Ibrahim) was afraid of them. They said, \"Don't be afraid,\" and they gave him good news with (the birth of) a pious son (Ishak). Then his wife came screaming (astonished) then patting herself on the face saying, \"(I am) an old barren woman.\" They said, \"Thus says your Lord. Indeed, He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing.\" (adz-dzariyat\/51: 28-30) The angel also informed that Isaac was a prophet and from him Jacob would descend who was also a prophet. Both are among God's servants who are pious, people who like to do good, and bring benefit to their people. Regarding the news of Isaac's birth, God also reported it in other surahhs such as in surahh Hud\/11: 69-73, surahh Maryam\/19: 49 and surahh al-Anbiya'\/21: 72. Among commentators there is an opinion that Isaac who Abraham will slaughter to fulfill God's command, not his brother Ismail. In his commentary, Ibn Kathir quoted al-Bagawi's statement that Umar, Ali, Ibn Mas'ud and al-'Abbas (Ibnu 'Abbas) believed that Isaac would be the victim. The source of this opinion is from the Jews who converted to Islam. According to Ibn Kathir, all opinions that say that Isaac will be slaughtered originate from Ka'bul-Akhbar. He was a Jew who converted to Islam at the time of Caliph Umar, and read the contents of the Torah to Umar. Talking about differences of opinion regarding this sacrifice, Ibn al-Qayyim in his book Zadul Ma'ad said that the correct opinion according to the scholars of the companions, the tabiin, and later scholars, was that Ismail was the one who was slaughtered by Ibrahim. Opinions that say the sacrifice was Isaac is very wrong in many ways. Ibn Taimiyah, as quoted by Ibn al-Qayyim, said, \"This opinion was expressed by the People of the Book, even though it contradicts the contents of the book itself.\" In the Torah it is said that Allah commanded Abraham to slaughter his first born son. Both Muslims and Ahl al-Kitab agree that the first born son was Ishmael. However, later they distorted the contents of the Torah by including the words: Slaughter your son Isaac. According to Ibn Taymiyah, \"That is the result of the twisting of the Jews, because the addition is contrary to the words of the first child, their only hatred for the descendants of Ishmael who gain glory, causes them to falsify the contents of this book.\" The second reason put forward by Ibn Taimiyah is based on the statement of the Qur'an: So We conveyed to him the good news about (the birth of) Isaac and after Isaac (will be born) Jacob. (Hud\/11: 71) Allah informed Sarah of the birth of Isaac, who would give birth to a child named Jacob. So it is impossible for Allah to convey the birth of Isaac and then order to slaughter him even though it has been stated that Jacob will descend from him. How could Jacob be born into the world if his father was sacrificed, even though he was promised to be born from the seed of Isaac? So if that's the case it's not Isaac who's being slaughtered but Ishmael. The third reason for Ibn Taimiyah refers to the news of Abraham and his son in this surahh ash-shaffat. In verses 103-111 it is told that when Ibrahim was about to slaughter his son to carry out God's command, then a voice came to rebuke him from behind, calling out that Abraham by his actions was deemed to have carried out God's order. For his sincere obedience, Ibrahim was rewarded and praised by Allah. After that incident, Allah then informed Abraham about the birth of Isaac, as Allah's reward for his patience and obedience. Thus, of course it was not Isaac who would be slaughtered, because he had not yet been born. The fourth reason: that the event that Abraham was going to slaughter his son took place near Mecca, there is no doubt. Therefore, the sacrificial service is held on the pilgrimage day. Also the sa'i between Safa and Marwah and stoning during the pilgrimage are memories of what happened to Ismail and his mother. As is known, Ismail and his mother lived in Mecca. The time and place of sacrifice is always associated with the Baitulharam. If Isaac were to be sacrificed, the sacrifice would have been held at the place where Isaac lived (Sham), not in Mecca. These are some of the reasons given by Ibn Taimiyah to refute the opinion that Isaac was the one who was slaughtered. (See also the information contained in the vocabulary of Abraham and Ismail)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the blessings and welfare of the life of the world and the hereafter were bestowed by Allah to Abraham and Isaac. From both of them were born descendants who were widespread and from their descendants many prophets and apostles emerged. Muslims are told to always ask God every time they pray that Abraham and his family will be blessed and happy. Of their children and grandchildren who are widely spread across the face of the earth, there are those who do good and some who are unjust to themselves. Those who do good are those who believe in Allah, uphold His commandments, and stay away from His prohibitions according to the instructions of His messengers. As for those who commit injustice against themselves, they are those who deny the religion brought by the apostles and commit wickedness and disobedience. This verse reminds people that from a noble and honorable family, good or bad offspring may be born. Heredity or race does not provide a guarantee to be noble or despicable for offspring because it still depends on efforts to educate and foster children. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are people whom God declared to have reached the level of glory. Allah's Word: And remember Our servants: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob who have great powers and (high) knowledge. (shad\/38: 45) However, the descendants of Jacob, who are called the Children of Israel, both in ancient history and in modern history, have experienced much suffering and humiliation. The reason is because they are unjust to themselves, disobedient to their ancestors, and abandoned the guidance of Allah and the prophets."

Indeed, she (also) will be overwritten (torment) that befalls them. Verily when it occurs their torment is at dawn. Isn't dawn near?\" (Hud\/11: 81). When dawn came, the promised disaster came, that is, the land was turned upside down so that those who disbelieved were buried in the earth. Allah's Word: So when Our decision came, We overturned the land of the people of Lut, and We showered them with stones from burning ground, marked by your Lord. And the torment is not far from the wrongdoer. (Hud\/11: 82-83) Besides that, the country was hit by a big typhoon which brought stones so that it destroyed and buried the country, as informed in another verse: The people of Lut also belied this warning. Verily, We sent them a storm that brought stones (that fell on them), except the family of Lut. We saved them before dawn. (al-Qamar\/54: 33-34) Because the Prophet Lut, some of his family, and his faithful followers were outside their city, they were all safe. What did not survive was an old woman, namely his wife. He obeyed his rebellious people rather than following the Prophet Lut. Therefore, he remained in the country, thus becoming a victim too."

			"tafsir": "Furthermore, the angels explained that when carrying out their duties, they marched in rows, that is, they were always swift in carrying out their duties and working together in strong units. By lining up like that, the task is carried out with enthusiasm, enthusiasm, and perfection, so that the implementation of the task is maximally successful without anything lacking or excess. Carrying out their duties seriously indicates that they are very obedient to Allah and carry out His commands. The obedience and seriousness of angels in carrying out their duties needs to be imitated by Muslims. In an authentic hadith narrated by Muslim originating from Jabir bin Samurah, he says: From Jabir bin Samurah that the Messenger of Allah once came out to meet us while we were in the mosque, then he said, 'Why don't you line up like angels line up beside his god? Then we asked, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah, how can the angels line up beside their Lord? The Messenger of Allah said, 'They filled the first row to the brim and filled it in.' (Muslim History) Inspired by this verse, Caliph Umar bin Khaththab arranged the rows before leading the prayer. Reported by Abu Nadhrah: Umar ra when the iqamat was recited, he faced congregation and said, \"Arrange your rows, straighten your ranks! Allah Ta'ala wants you to follow the behavior of angels.\" Then he recited the verse: \"wa inna lanahnu ash-shaffun\" \"O Fulan backwards, O Fulan forwards!\" After that he came forward and recited the takbir (leading the prayer). Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir)."

			"tafsir": "Then Allah explained the behavior of the angels that they always glorify Him. Exaltation is purifying Allah from qualities that are not worthy of Him, whether in the form of deficiencies, such as weakness, sleepiness, needing helpers\/children and so on or disgraceful qualities such as being angry, wrongdoing, and so on. Praising is not enough just by saying, by reciting subhanallah, but it needs to be accompanied by actions. A perfect example of tasbih is what angels do, whereby they not only continuously praise Allah but also fully carry out His commands."

However, they deny the prophet and the holy book. Their actions are described in another verse: And they swore in the name of Allah solemnly that if a warner came to them, surely they would get more guidance from one of the (other) peoples. But when the warner comes to them, does not add (anything) to them, even further they are from (the truth) (Fathir\/35: 42) At the end of the verse, Allah swt confirms that those who disbelieve will later know what the consequences of disbelief they. Namely that they will be miserable both in this world with defeat, and in the hereafter, namely being tormented in hell forever. The threat should make them fear and then believe."

To answer this challenge, Allah asked whether they really wanted the doom of the hereafter to be hastened. Allah states that if the doom of the hereafter is hastened and descended upon their home page, then the calamity that befalls them will be immeasurahble. Namely the coming of the catastrophe in the morning, when the people who were threatened still wanted to sleep before sunrise, so they were not ready to face it. The great calamity of the morning can be taken as an example from the Prophet's attack on Khaibar at dawn which resulted in the fall of the fort: From Anas ra that he said, \"Rasulullah was in Khaibar in the morning. When they (Jews resident of Khaibar) came out with axes and spears them, and seeing the army, they ran and shouted, 'Muhammad, by Allah, Muhammad and his army!\" The Prophet said, 'God is great, Khaibar is destroyed. When we arrived at their yard, it was a very bad dawn for those people who were threatened.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim)."
