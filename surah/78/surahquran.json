			"tafsir": "When the polytheists of Mecca gathered at their meeting place which was near the Baitullah, they often discussed the condition of the Prophet Muhammad and the Al-Qur'an he had brought with him. They often asked one another whether Muhammad was a sorcerer, a poet, or a sorcerer who was corrupted by their idols? They also wonder whether the Qur'an is magic, poetry, or just incantations? Each of them expressed their opinion according to their desires and dreams, while the Prophet Muhammad himself calmly conveyed his appeal based on the verses of the Qur'an which give light to mankind towards the path of truth and straight guidance. In addition, they often talk about the day of resurrection, which often creates debate, because some of them deny it and think that after death their business will be finished. There is no more resurrection after death. They argue that humans are born into the world and then they die and are swallowed up by the earth because nothing destroys them except time or time. On the other hand, there are also those who think that it is only the spirits that are resurrected and not the bodies that have been eaten up by the earth. There were also those who met one of the Prophet's companions and asked about it in a scornful manner. In connection with their attitude like that, this surahh came down to refute their denial, and put forward a real argument that Allah is truly Almighty to raise them back after death, even though they had become soil, eaten by wild beasts, swallowed by fish in the sea, burned by fire. and blown away by the wind, or other reasons. In this verse, Allah denounces the dispute among the disbelievers of Mecca regarding the day of resurrection by saying, \"About what do the polytheists among the inhabitants of Mecca question each other?\" God answered their questions with His word. What is meant by very big news in this verse is news about the Day of Judgment. It is called a very big news because the Day of Judgment will be very riotous as mentioned in the word of Allah: O people! Fear your Lord; indeed, the shock (day) of Doomsday is a very big (event). (Remember) on the day when you see it (the shaking), all women who breastfeed their children will be neglectful of the child they are nursing, and every woman who is pregnant will have a miscarriage, and you will see people in a drunken state, even though they are not drunk, but doom God is very harsh. (al-hajj\/22: 1-2) Even so, polytheists still doubt and even many do not believe, as Allah explains in His word: (Life) is nothing but our life in this world, (there ) we died and lived and will not be resurrected (again). (al-Mu'minun\/23: 37) Allah's Word: We do not know what the Day of Judgment is, we are just guessing, and we are not sure. (al-Jatsiyah\/45: 32) As for Divine wisdom in conveying this issue in the form of questions and answers, this is to bring it closer to understanding and explanation, as contained in the word of Allah: (Then Allah said), \"To whom does the kingdom today belong?\" Belongs to Allah, the One and Only, the All-Conquering. (Gafir\/40: 16) Then Allah answered their question in a threatening tone, \"Absolutely not. Far from the truth of what they think is. Later they will find out when they witness the actual situation on the Day of Judgment which they always deny. \" It is better for them not to make fun of it because they will know the truth later. Anything that is doubtful they will surely experience. God strengthens His word by repeating the statement one more time. Then Allah explained His almighty power and the signs of His mercy which were often forgotten by them. Yet the signs were clearly visible before the eyes. Allah put forward nine things that they could see with their eyes as evidence showing His power, as mentioned in the following verses, namely from verse 6 to verse 14."

			"tafsir": "Seventh, God builds seven firm heavens above mankind without pillars and submits to God's law. Scientifically, the seven solid heavens can possibly be interpreted by the layers of the atmosphere close to this earth, such as: (1) Troposphere (Troposphere), (2) Tropopause (Tropopaus), (3) Stratosphere (Stratosphere), (4) Stratopause (Stratopaus), (5) Mesosphere (Mesosphere), (6) Mesopause (Mesopause), and (7) Thermosphere (Thermosphere). This division is based on the temperature (temperature) of the layers of the atmosphere and their distance from the earth's surface. The robustness of these layers, in the sense of being sturdy in enveloping our globe, is due to the earth's gravitational force. (See also scientific studies in surahh ar-Ra'd\/13:2, Juz-13). In the scientific study of surahh ar-Ra'd\/13: 2, the division of the layers of the atmosphere is slightly different from that described in this scientific study, where the ionosphere and exosphere are united in the thermosphere. However, if the understanding of the seven heavens is associated with the Ascension of the Prophet Muhammad, it seems inappropriate. The seven skies in surahh an-Naba'\/78: 12 may be interpreted as the Seven Dimensions of Space-Time in the Kaluza-Klein Theory (KKT). As stated in physics, there are four (4) Fundamental Forces in this universe, namely the Electromagnetic Force, the Weak Nuclear Force, the Strong Nuclear Force, and the Gravitational Force. If these four forces were formed from the Big Bang of a Singularity, then these four forces must have previously 'unified as One Single Force (Grand Unified Force), this is what is known in the Grand Unified Theory (GUT, Theory of Great Unity?). KKT explains that in order to be able to explain the unity of the four forces, the existence of the space-time geometry that we are in today is not enough. The geometry of space-time that we live in today can only say so much about Electromagnetic forces and in some cases Gravitational Forces. In order to be able to explain these four styles, the KKT stated that there must be seven other time-space dimensions. Thus with the four dimensions that are already known, namely: line, plane, space and time; then the total dimensions are eleven (11) dimensions. This statement is based on Mathematical-Physical calculations. Based on this KKT, scientists have also been able to calculate the 'diameter of one of the space-time dimensions, which is 10-32 cm, so that dimension is very small. Thus, it is impossible with the instruments that exist today that we can penetrate the other seven dimensions of space-time. The Kaluza-Klein Theory has provided a description of the existence of Seven Space-Time Dimensions, all of which will establish the geometry of the universe with its four fundamental forces. Could it be that the seven firm heavens are the seven dimensions of space-time according to the Kaluza-Klein Theory? Wallahu a'lam bis-sawab."

(al-Insyiqaq\/84: 1) This happens because there has been a major change in the arrangement of the planets in the universe, which has caused a change in their attractions and orbits. That incident led to the destruction of the universe, and also the destruction of the world's natural world."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, it is explained that on that day the mountains will no longer be as they were before, but will be shaken so that they crumble like mist which from afar looks like the shadow of water. However, when approached, it turns out there is nothing because the pieces have been broken, destroyed, and flying everywhere. God's Word in this regard: And the earth and the mountains were lifted up, then they collided with one blow. (al-haqqah\/69: 14) Then in another verse Allah says: And the mountains are crushed to pieces, so they become dust flying. (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 5-6) Then the mountains will be crushed like dust flying as described in the word of Allah: And the mountains are like fluff. (al-Qari'ah\/101: 5) Verses 17-20 of surahh an-Naba'\/78 above seem to speak of the doomsday. In the verse discussed, there is a description of the trumpet blowing. There are other verses that also use the word trumpet or trumpet in describing the apocalypse, such as surahh an-Nazi'at\/79: 6-9, \"(Indeed, you will be resurrected) on the day when the first blast shakes nature, (the first blast) is accompanied by with the second blast. The human heart at that time was very afraid, his eyes were submissive.\" The four verses above discuss what will happen when the Day of Judgment occurs. One of the events that day was a very powerful earthquake. In verses 6-9 of surahh an-Nazi'at\/79, an earthquake event, possibly an earthquake, is described by the word \"blowing\". If we look at verses 6 and 7 of surahh an-Nazi'at\/79 above, it appears that there is a similarity in the description of the Day of Judgment. However, there are two opinions regarding its depiction. On the one hand, the scholars interpret the word ar-rajifah as the sound of the first trumpet, and ar-radifah as the sound of the second trumpet. On the other hand, ar-rajifah is declared as the earth, and ar-radifah as the time of the trial. There are also those who interpret ar-rajifah as the chaos of the elements of the earth, while ar-radifah is the earthquake. It seems the latter opinion is more realistic. There is no difference between the chaos of the earth's elements and an earthquake. However, there seems to be another opinion that makes more sense. Perhaps the two words that many scholars try to interpret actually indicate a main earthquake and aftershocks, as can be seen in the translation and tafsir of verses 6 and 7 of surahh an-Nazi'at\/79 in Tafsir Al-Misbah, \"On the day when the earthquake shook terrible, followed by those who accompany (him).\" Before the main earthquake (main shock), several small earthquakes (fore shock) will start. After the main earthquake occurs, it is followed by aftershocks which are smaller in strength and numerous in number. Gradually these aftershocks decreased both in number and strength. Please note that the initial earthquake is difficult to identify. Usually the main earthquake comes immediately, and destroys everything without showing any initial earthquake. As an illustration, the Aceh earthquake that occurred on December 26, 2004 with a magnitude of Mw=9.3 came without an initial earthquake. The earthquake that broke the seabed along nearly 1000 km caused a tsunami and destroyed the area around the Indian Ocean. The Aceh earthquake then triggered the Nias earthquake with a very large strength, namely Mw = 8.7. So, in essence the Nias earthquake was not an aftershock but an earthquake that was triggered by the first big earthquake. Both the Aceh and Nias earthquakes were followed by their respective aftershocks. With this description, the earthquakes that will come on the Day of Judgment will be far more devastating and capable of triggering earthquakes that are just as devastating so that the earth is devastated."
