Some are so far away from the earth that their light in normal calculations only reaches us after thousands of years, some even after billions of years. Allah swears by a cluster of stars because it has extraordinary miracles and contains great wisdom and is very useful for humans in their lives. These various miracles and wisdom show us about the greatness of the Creator who is Almighty and Most High in His Knowledge and All-Wise."

The heathen of the land sat around the ditches watching the inhuman torture. The torment was actually not what they should have done because these people had no major faults. They torture them simply because the believers believe in Allah, the Mighty, Most Praised, who has the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and has power over everything in them. There really is no way for the unjust person to escape from His power. For believers, this torment and killing is only a trial and a test that will bring them eternal happiness if they remain patient and have faith in Allah."
