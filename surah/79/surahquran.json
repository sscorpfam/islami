This is in order to emphasize the existence of the day of resurrection which the polytheists deny. The following verses are also in the form of oath sentences to the angels who descend from the sky quickly carrying God's commands. Even Allah swore to the angels who preceded other angels with a bang, as well as the angels who govern the world. Words in the form of this oath are found in many Makkiyyah surahs because many polytheists reject and deny the resurrection day, such as in surahh as-saffat\/37: 1-4: For the sake of (the entourage of angels) who line up in rows, for the sake of (the group) that prevents seriously, for the sake of (the group) that reads the warning, indeed, your Lord is truly One. (as-saffat\/37: 1-4) As for the answer to the qasam (contents of the oath) at the beginning of surahh an-Nazi'at, it is found in verse 6, that is, when nature shook when the first trumpet was blown, everything was damaged and destroyed. The first trumpet blast is then followed by the second blast which raises people from their graves. This is Doomsday in the truest sense. The early verses in surahh an-Nazi'at are understood by the majority of commentators as oaths to the angels. However, there are other commentators, such as Ahmad Mustafa al-Maragi, who understand this oath not to the angels, but to the stars that revolve according to certain rules, such as the sun, moon and other planets. In the tafsir of al-MarAgi, these verses are understood as the stars that move quickly and swiftly, the light that comes out from star to star, and the stars that move quickly from other stars. As for the understanding of the qasam answer, it is the same as the opinion of the jumhur mufasir."

Allah then establishes provisions that govern the celestial bodies, so that they remain in place and do not fall, as if they were decorations for the entire universe. Creating and managing the universe (macrocosm) is much more complicated and complex than creating humans who are only called microcosms. Today's modern scientific studies state that the entire universe began with its formation from a singularity. Singularity is something where space, energy, matter and time candidates are still gathered into one (unified). The Big Bang exploded this singularity and it grew like a spiral-cone that was continuously expanding wider and wider. It was since the Big Bang that time began to separate itself from space, as well as energy, matter and forces to separate itself, and over billions of years the entire universe, which contains billions of galaxies, was formed. Space and time continue to experience widespread expansion. This is what is called \"raising the building (the sky)\". Bahiruddin S. Mahmud explained that the expansion of the universe is not infinite, not continuous. The rate of this expansion or development gradually decreases, because the gravitational force between galaxies (which they keep moving away from each other) begins to relax, so that one day the expansion of the universe will stop, then the building will be perfect."

The Prophet himself did not know about the time of his arrival, as Allah says in the Qur'an: Your obligation is nothing but to convey (the message). (asy-Syura\/42: 48) In a hadith narrated by 'Umar bin al-Khaththab, when the Prophet was asked about when the Day of Judgment would come, he replied: The person who is asked does not know more than the person asking. (Muslim history from 'Umar bin al-Khatthab) Allah keeps secret when the Day of Judgment comes and has great wisdom, namely that humans always prepare themselves at all times by doing lots of good deeds and always avoiding evil deeds."
