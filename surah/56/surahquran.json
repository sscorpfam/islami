(alMursalat\/77: 29-34) The extraordinary hot samum wind and black clouds which also add to the extraordinary hot atmosphere are what cause them to feel thirst and thirst that is incomparable and which is no longer unbearable, which forces them to drink as much as you can even though the water you drink is hot and boiling like melted lead and copper. Thus, the more barrage of torture and punishment they feel."

Are they the ones who send down the water from the sky, namely rain water or is it Allah who sends it down. When people contemplate rain water, that it comes from water vapor that is exposed to the heat of the sun. After it becomes a cloud and then becomes a very black, lumpy cloud, the water vapor descends as rainwater which is cool and fresh, not salty like sea water. The fresh water refreshes the body and quenches thirst. If there is no rain, surely there will be no flowing rivers, there will be no springs, no matter how many meters deep a person digs a well, surely the water will not come out. If there is no water, grass will not grow, let alone plants planted by people. If there is no rain, there is definitely no water that can be utilized by humans. If plants and vegetation do not grow, then livestock will not exist. There will be no chickens, no buffaloes and cows, no goats and sheep. Because life requires eating and drinking. If you have nothing to eat and nothing to drink, how can you live? And if there are no plants and vegetation, and no fresh water to drink, how can humans live? Do you have to eat soil? And what to drink? If water is used by God to taste salty, it certainly cannot quench thirst and cannot be used to water or irrigate plants. And who sent down the rain? Isn't it only Allah who can send down rain so that it flows and wells can emit water? Why is man ungrateful to God? Even though it is He who sends down rain which has so many benefits as He says: It is He who sends down water (rain) from the sky for you, some of it for drink and some of it (fertilizes) plants, in which you graze your livestock. With (the rain) He causes to grow for you plants, olives, dates, grapes and all kinds of fruits. Indeed, in that there is truly a sign (of Allah's greatness) for those who think. (an-Nahl\/16: 10-11) In this connection there is a hadith which reads: Indeed, when the Prophet finished drinking, he said, \"Praise be to Allah who has given us fresh water to drink which is refreshing by His grace and does not make it salty.\" because of our sins.\" (History of Ibn Abi Hatim from Abu Ja'far) According to scientific studies, water that is drinkable and not harmful to human health is water that contains sufficient and balanced salt and dissolved elements, and does not contain toxic substances. Water containing excess amounts of salt and dissolved elements, for example sea water, when drunk is harmful to health and can damage the organs of the body. The government of each country usually has regulations that provide limits on water that can be drunk based on the results of an analysis of the dissolved elements. Ordinary drinkable water is characterized by clear color, fresh aroma and good taste (see also: alFurqan\/25: 48). Water that can be drunk is water that is on land that comes from rainwater. Seawater is unfit for drinking unless it has been treated through distillation or ultrafiltration. This verse also reaffirms that it is Allah who sends down the rain. Although technology has now been developed to carry out artificial rain, this technology can only be applied to certain atmospheric conditions that occur beyond human control, the most important requirement of which is the availability of adequate amounts of water vapor in the air."

			"tafsir": "In this verse Allah reveals about the favors that humans almost forget. The expression is in the form of a question for humans to think about and ponder, do humans know the importance of the function of fire? The way to make fire in ancient times was by rubbing two sticks of wood together, until they ignited, or by scraping steel on a stone, so that a fire sparked and the spark was collected in kawul (a kind of blackish cotton attached to the palm fronds). Then it can be used to light a fire in the kitchen to cook various dishes that will be served for human enjoyment, or a fire that is lit according to the current method by scratching a cigarette lighter on a match, then it ignites. Or with a match that uses a small steel wheel as a rotary tool to be rotated on the flint and then the spark is collected on a wick soaked in gasoline, so that the wick ignites. Or like the current way through a kerosene stove or with gas. Making fire in the ancient way or according to the modern way, the question is who provided the wood or the flint, the steel and the kawul or the kerosene and gas? Also who provides fuel and so on? Aren't the materials that cause the fire to burn, either in the form of firewood or kerosene, only Allah made it? Even though rice, vegetables and side dishes are available, if there is no fire, we cannot eat them because they are still raw. How unpleasant, if the food is raw like, raw meat, and the rice is still rice. How can appetite arise, if everything is completely raw? With this description, it is clear how important fire is for human needs. Because fire is easily obtained every day, it is almost unthinkable to humans how much pleasure fire gives. It's almost rare for people to be grateful and grateful for the existence of fire. Because of the importance of fire, Allah emphasized that fire is used as a warning for humans and a useful material for travelers in the desert, so it is only natural for humans to glorify by mentioning the name of God the Greatest."

			"tafsir": "Some commentators explain this verse, that Allah swears by the time when parts of the Qur'an were revealed to show how important it is. The Al-Qur'an was sent down all at once from Lauh Mahfudz to the nearest sky on the night of Lailatul Qadar (a very glorious night). Then, it was sent down again gradually according to its needs from the heavens of the world to the Prophet Muhammad until it was completely completed within 22 years 2 months 22 days. The period of the revelation of the parts of the Qur'an has an important meaning, the wisdom of the revelation of the parts, namely each surahh or each verse, is so that each surah or verse can be understood more broadly and in more depth. Allah confirms that the oaths in these passages of the Qur'an are very significant because they contain a hint of the majesty of Allah's power and the perfection of His wisdom and the vastness of His mercy and does not neglect His servants. In verse 75, Allah swore to convince His servants with something that describes His omnipotence over this universe, namely a \"place where the stars circulate.\" If only humans could see how orderly the stars always move in their respective orbits safely and harmoniously, they would have a different opinion. With the development of science and technology, it is known how many collections of stars in the sky are countless. Astrophysicists and astronomers explain that it is impossible for the naked eye to see the contents of the infinitely vast universe. The Solar System which consists of millions of stars maybe even more (including our earth) is only a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy which contains more than 100 billion stars. Even the Milky Way is only one of more than 500 billion galaxies in the known universe, subhanallah! All of the stars circulate in their orbits, including our sun. As stated in the word of God: And the sun circulates in its circulation. Such is the decree of the Almighty and All-Knowing. (Yasin\/36: 38) Based on the observations of experts, the sun moves at a high speed of about 720,000 km per hour towards the star Vega in a certain orbit in the Solar Apex system. Together with the sun, and all the planets and satellites that are within the Solar System (solar system) also move at the same distance. All these celestial bodies move to occupy the orbits that have been counted (calculated). For several million years, all of them 'swimmed' across their respective orbits in perfect balance and arrangement with each other. Orbits within the universe also belong to galaxies moving at great speeds in predetermined orbits. When moving, none of these celestial bodies cross orbits or collide with other celestial bodies. However, this was clearly explained to mankind in the Qur'an that was revealed at that time, because the Qur'an is actually the word of the Sovereign, Who Protects and Maintains the Stability of the Universe."

			"tafsir": "Allah explains that this Al-Qur'an is a divine revelation that contains infinite benefits and benefits and contains knowledge and definite instructions that bring happiness to humans for the life of the world and the hereafter, and reading it is one of worship. Al-Qur'an is a source of knowledge of monotheism, jurisprudence, tasawuf, and others. The purity of the Qur'an is guaranteed, only the Angel al-Muqarrabin has ever touched it from the Lawh Mahfudz, namely the Angel Gabriel who was assigned to deliver it to the Prophet Muhammad. Regarding verse 79, some commentators differ. Nothing touched it except the consecrated servants. (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 79) The majority of scholars suggest that verse 79 prohibits people with small or large hadas from touching or holding the Mushaf of the Qur'an, based on the hadith of Mu'adh bin Jabal, The Prophet said, \"It is not permissible to touch the Mushaf except holy people.\" This opinion is held by the majority of Indonesian Muslims. There are two opinions regarding the ruling on touching the mushaf, namely: 1. Imams of the four schools of thought are not allowed to touch the mushaf without ablution. According to Imam Nawawi, God's word: la yamassuhu illal-muthahharun means not to touch this mushaf except the saint from hadas. 2. The az-Â¨ahiri school argues that it is permissible to touch a mushaf without ablution on the grounds that the Prophet Muhammad once sent a letter containing verses from the Koran to Heraclius even though he was not a Muslim and did not perform ablution. Small children bring places to write the Koran and books that have the writings of the Koran allowed by the scholars. Furthermore, Allah explained that the Qur'an was actually revealed from God who controls the universe. As a life guide to be read, memorized, understood and practiced. So those who accuse the Qur'an of magic or poetry are really misguided."

			"tafsir": "These verses explain that everything that has been revealed in this surahh, both regarding matters related to the day of resurrection that they deny and those related to evidence that shows the truth of the things that will happen after the day of resurrection, that is related to God's favors that will be received by the Ashabul-yamin group (muqarrabin) and God's punishment that will befall the Ashabusy-syimal group, all of that is convincing news that does not contain the slightest bit of doubt. In this regard, humans are commanded by Allah to increase their acts of worship and good deeds, among others by reciting tasbih, to glorify Allah, the Most High God. In connection with this verse, there is a hadith of the Prophet which reads: When the Fasabbih Bismirabbikal-'Adzim verse was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, he said, \"Make Tasbih recitation when you bow down' (i.e. by reading Subhanarabbial-'Adzim)\", and when the Sabbihismarabbikal verse was revealed A'la. Rasulullah said, \"Make this Tasbih reading when you prostrate (ie by reading Subhanarabbial-A'la)\" (History of Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah from 'Uqbah bin 'Amir al-Juhani)"
