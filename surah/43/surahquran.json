			"ayat": 11,
			"tafsir": "Allah sends down rain from the sky according to the need to support plants and vegetation. He sends rain not more than what is needed so that it does not overflow beyond the limit and eventually becomes a disaster, like a flood that destroys and destroys, and not too little so that it does not meet the needs for the fertility of plants and vegetation that causes dryness and withered, and resulted in a famine that befell God's creatures everywhere. With rain falling from the sky according to the amount needed, the dead country will live and prosper, which will no longer grow plants and trees. As Allah has the power to revive a dead land, so He has the power to revive and bring the dead out of the graves alive, as Allah says: And He sends down water (rain) from the sky, then with that water revives the earth after death ( dry). (ar-Rum\/30: 24) And His words: So We directed the cloud to a dead (barren) land then with that rain We revived the earth after it was dead (dry). That's what awakening is like. (Fathir\/35: 9) What is stated in this verse is proven by the science that humans have discovered today. It is estimated that in one second, as many as 16 million tons of water evaporate from the earth. Using this figure, it is calculated that there will be 513 trillion tons of water evaporating from the earth in a year. This figure turns out to be the same as the calculation of the amount of rainwater that falls in a year. Thus, water carries out a constantly balanced circulation. Life on earth is very dependent on the continuation of this water cycle. Although many technologies try to interfere with this natural cycle, such as making artificial rain, in reality the water cycle cannot be created artificially. The proportion of rainwater is important not only in terms of the amount, but also the speed with which the raindrops fall [according to the required size]. The speed of raindrops does not exceed the standard speed, no matter what size the raindrops are. Generally, raindrops have a diameter of 4.5 mm. Its speed is about 8 meters per second. At a smaller size, of course, the speed is lower. On a grain size larger than 4.5 mm, it does not mean that the speed is higher. The speed is constant, which is about 8 meters per second. This is because the liquid form of the droplets will interact with the air and wind so that the shape of the water droplets changes in such a way that the falling speed decreases and does not exceed the standard speed. It has been said in surahh Fussilat\/41: 39 to revive a dead land with water (rain) from the sky, that by raining down on a barren area, the area will (can, by Allah's will) grow trees. In this verse it is emphasized that water from the sky is sent down according to certain levels. The resurrection of humans after the grave is often likened to reviving barren land with rainwater. We can compare this parable to the growth of wild grains or spores that are carried by the wind and scattered on dry ground. If the dry soil gets enough rain showers [according to the size needed], the seeds will grow into sprouts and then become plants. If there is a lot of rainfall, the seeds or spores that become the seeds of plants will be washed away by the flow of water. If the flow of water does not wash it away, but if the moisture content in the soil is too excessive, the seeds will not grow into sprouts, instead they will rot. Everything according to size."

He also makes vehicles in the form of boats, ships that can be used to transport people and merchandise needs at sea, and livestock, such as camels, horses, himars, cows and others that can be used as means of transportation on land, and so on. others that can connect one place to another, both on land and at sea with various means of transportation. In accordance with the word of Allah: And (He has created) horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride and (to be) ornaments. Allah creates what you do not know.

(az-Zukhruf\/43: 13-14) If Allah had not subdued the universe with the knowledge He bestowed, surely humans would not have been able to do it, because that would be beyond their ability. The prayer reading reminds people to always be prepared for the day of vengeance when all humans will face and experience it and do not neglect to remember Allah, whether traveling or not, while sailing or living in your hometown. In connection with the above tafsir, it was narrated by Imam Muslim, Abu Dawud, and an-Nasa'i that the Messenger of Allah, when traveling and driving said three times and recited the prayer mentioned above. When the Prophet saw was driving his vehicle to make a journey, then he said takbir three times. Then he read, \"Glory to God (Allah) who has subjected all of this to us when we were not able to control it before, and verily we will return to our Lord.\" (History of Muslim, Abu Dawud, and an-Nasa'i) The verse above teaches people to be grateful for God's blessings that have been given in the form of animals and treat them well. Equality among creatures, especially between animals and humans, is emphasized by God. One of the verses below explains that animals are also God's people, just like humans. Even though they have different characteristics, specialties and systems, in essence, they are the same as human beings in the eyes of God. And humans are obliged to remember it. And there is not a single animal that is on the earth and birds that fly on its two wings, but all are nations (too) like you. There is nothing that We have omitted in the Book, then to God they are gathered.\" (al-An'am\/6: 38) Several verses of the Qur'an allude to animals, including how humans should behave towards animals, the use of animals for humans, the behavior of animals that humans must imitate, and many others.In this relationship of equality between creatures, there is a writing by a wise man, Muhammad Fazlur Rahman Ansari, which reads, \"Everything on this earth was created for us, so it is already it is our natural duty to: guard against decay; utilize it while maintaining its dignity as God's creation; preserving it as much as possible, thus, being grateful for God's blessings in the form of concrete actions.\" Regarding animals or pets, the Qur'an in surahh an-Nahl\/16: 5 mentions some of the benefits of animals for humans: And livestock have been created - It is for you, there is (fur) that warms and various benefits, and some of it you eat.(an-Nahl\/16: 5) In connection with the verse from surahh an-Nahl above, we must pay attention that, for example, the skin and livestock fur may be used. But the Prophet Muhammad saw continued with one very wise thing. He forbade the use of wild animal skins even just for floor mats. If the rules or advice put forward by the Prophet were obeyed by everyone, then the killing of some types of wild animals for the sake of profit alone certainly do not happen. Similarly, even though Muslims are allowed to consume the meat of certain animals, but keep in mind that this does not justify the cruel and uncontrolled slaughter of them. One of the benefits of animals is as a mount. We must remember that the Arabs in the past relied entirely on camels to help carry goods on their journeys. God states this in the verse below: And he carries your burdens to a land that you cannot reach, except with great difficulty. Verily, your Lord is Most Gracious, Most Merciful. And (He has created) horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and (to be) ornaments. Allah creates what you do not know. (an-Nahl\/16: 7-8) In essence, Islam teaches its people to love animals and preserve their lives. In the Qur'an, Allah emphasizes that He has bestowed upon mankind a dominion which encompasses everything in this world. And He has subjected what is in the heavens and what is on earth to you all (as mercy) from Him. (al-Jatsiyah\/45: 13). In this verse, the Qur'an does not indicate at all that man has absolute power to do as he pleases everything in the heavens and the earth. Nor do they have unlimited rights to use nature so as to damage their ecological balance. \"....all of that is from Him....\" The verse fragment here should be realized and understood as a reminder from God, that humans do not own anything in this world. So how should we treat other people's things must always be kept in mind \"...people who think....\" Islam basically does not support humans to abuse animals for sporting purposes or to make animals as objects of random experiments. This verse reminds mankind that the Creator has made everything in nature (including animals) a trust that they must protect."

This happened when he conveyed the verse,\" \"Indeed, you (unbelievers) and what you worship besides Allah, are fuel for Hell,\" (al-Anbiya'\/21: 98). They cheered for joy, because thought to have reasons to prove that the Prophet Muhammad acted wrongly based on that verse. This is because the Prophet Isa is worshiped by some people. That way he will also go to hell with those who worship him. To refute this view Allah sent down the verse, \"Indeed, long ago for those who have good (statutory) from Us, they will be kept away (from hell),\" (al-Anbiya'\/21:101). Thus the Prophet Isa, 'Uzair, and the priests and monks monks who are devout and only worship Allah, will enter heaven, and misguided people who then make them gods other than Allah will go to hell. Regarding Isa himself who is worshiped by those who are astray this verse was revealed to refute it, \"And when the son of Maryam so fish of parables, suddenly your people, O Muhammad, cheered for it,\" that is, cheered you on for His words. Then Allah explained, \"He (Isa) is nothing but a servant whom We bestow favors on and We make a sign for the Children of Israel. And if We so will, We really make some of you angels on earth for generations. And he (Isa) is indeed proof of the existence of the Last Day….\""

Allah emphasized that if He wanted, He could create humans to become angels who inhabit this earth for generations, or replace humans on earth who also live to reproduce until the Day of Judgment. Then are the angels the children of God and worthy of worship?

That's because Prophet Isa had great miracles, such as bringing the dead back to life, healing blindness, and so on. These miracles are proof that Allah, who gave them, is able to create the Day of Judgment. In addition, authentic hadiths inform that Prophet Isa will come before the Day of Judgment. This hadith was narrated from various sources, including Abu Hurairah, Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ikrimah, al-Hasan, Qatadah, and adh-ahhak, so that it is considered mutawatir by some scholars. Among these hadiths are: The Prophet said, \"By (Allah) who controls my soul, almost came down to you Isa bin Maryam as a just judge. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Thus the meaning of this verse is that the emergence of Prophet Isa approaching the Doomsday is a sign that the Doomsday will come. Furthermore, Allah asks people not to doubt the coming of the Doomsday. Therefore they must prepare themselves by believing and doing good, so that they can reap the fruits of their faith and deeds later in the hereafter. In this way humans will live happy forever in the hereafter. Allah asked the Children of Israel to follow the teachings that He conveyed to the Prophet Isa regarding the existence of the Doomsday. The teachings regarding the existence of the Doomsday asked humans to do good in preparation for facing it. This teaching is the straight path that is absolutely true and can definitely lead people to a happy life in the hereafter.The straight path that is taught n Islam, which is the religion brought by all the prophets, including the last prophet, Muhammad saw."

The Prophet Isa conveyed the main points of the teachings he received from Allah SWT, including faith in Allah as God Almighty, faith in the existence of the afterlife, doing good to fellow human beings, and not doing evil deeds. The Prophet Isa emphasized that the main points of the teachings he conveyed were wisdom, namely monotheism that needed to be practiced, namely doing noble deeds and avoiding evil deeds that would determine the happiness of mankind in this world and the hereafter. (Regarding the details of what wisdom is, read surahh al-Isra'\/17: 23-39). The Prophet Isa also explained his other duties, namely explaining what was disputed by the Children of Israel. There are disputes related to religious matters, for example regarding whether animals with hoofs and fat from cows and sheep are unclean (al-An'am\/6:146). Prophet Isa came to explain the halalness of all that (Ali 'Imran\/3:50). According to Ibn Jarir, the dispute was about world issues, not about religion. This seems to be related to the division of the Children of Israel into various sects which were always fighting each other. After that Prophet Isa asked them to be pious, namely to do what Allah ordered and stay away from what He prohibited. Piety is a consequence of faith, namely carrying out the values contained in the wisdom above. That is, faith needs to be proven by carrying out these good deeds. And Prophet Isa asked his people to obey him, namely to carry out everything he conveyed and not always dispute religious teachings."

So do not worship other than Allah, because that will lead people astray. That is the straight path, namely the right way of life that guarantees happiness in this world and in the hereafter. The \"straight path\" in this verse is monotheism and good deeds. The \"straight path\" in verse 61 is believing in the existence of the hereafter which also requires good deeds. Thus the \"straight path\" in the two verses is the same in essence, because faith in Allah requires humans to believe in the hereafter and do good, and faith in the hereafter also requires humans to believe in Allah and do good."
