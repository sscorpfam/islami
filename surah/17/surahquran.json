			"tafsir": "Allah swt declares His majesty with the word \"subhana\", so that humans acknowledge His holiness from unworthy traits and believe in the attributes of His incomparable majesty. This expression is also a statement about the nature of His greatness that has traveled His servant one night, with a very fast journey. Allah swt begins His word with subhana in this verse, and in several other verses, as a sign that the verse contains extraordinary events that can only be carried out because of His will and power. From the word asra' it can be understood that the Prophet Muhammad's Isra' took place at night, because the word asra in Arabic means traveling at night. The mention of lailan, in the form isim nakirah, which means \"night\", is to illustrate that the Isra' incident took a short night and also to strengthen the notion that the Isra' event really took place at night. Allah swt sends His servant's Isra' at night, because that is the most important time for servants to get closer to Allah, and the best time to worship Him. The word 'abdihi (His servant) in this verse refers to the Prophet Muhammad who was chosen as the last prophet. He had received orders to make a night journey, as a tribute to him. This verse does not specify the exact time, both when the Prophet Muhammad departed and returned to his home in Mecca. It's just that it was explained that the Prophet Muhammad's Isra' started from the Grand Mosque, namely the mosque which is famous because the Kaaba (Baitullah) is located in it, to the Aqsa Mosque which is in Baitul Makdis. The mosque is called Masjid Al Aqsa which means \"farthest\", because it is far from the city of Mecca. Furthermore, Allah SWT explained that the Aqsa Mosque and the surrounding areas received Allah's blessings because they became the place for revelations to the prophets. The land is fertile, so that it becomes a prosperous area. In addition, the mosque is included among the mosques where the worship of the prophets and their residence. After that, Allah mentioned the reason why the Prophet Muhammad was traveling at night, namely to show the Prophet the signs of His greatness. These signs were witnessed by Muhammad saw on his journey from the Grand Mosque to the Aqsa Mosque, in the form of valuable experiences, fortitude in facing various kinds of trials, and how vast the universe is and how great Allah is the Creator. The new experiences witnessed by the Prophet Muhammad were very useful for strengthening his heart in facing various kinds of obstacles from his people, and believing in the truth of Allah's revelations, both those he had received and those he would receive. At the end of this verse, Allah swt explains that He is All-Hearing the inner whispers of His servants and All-Seeing of all their deeds. There is no heartbeat, or body movement of all creatures that exist between the heavens and the earth that escapes His observation. This verse mentions the event of Isra', namely the journey of the Prophet Muhammad from the Grand Mosque to the Aqsa Mosque at night. Meanwhile, the Mi'raj event, namely the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad from the Aqsa Mosque to Sidratul Muntaka (Mustawa) is not implied by this verse, but hinted at in surahh an-Najm. Almost all commentators are of the opinion that the Isra' event took place after the Prophet Muhammad was sent as an apostle. The incident occurred one year before the migration. This is according to Imam az-Zuhri, Ibn Sa'ad, and others. Imam Nawawi also confirmed this. In fact, according to Ibn Hazm, the Isra' incident took place in the month of Rajab, the twelfth year after the appointment of Muhammad as a prophet. Meanwhile, al-hafidh 'Abdul Gani al-Maqdisi chose the opinion that the Isra' and Mi'raj occurred on the 27th of Rajab, arguing that at that time the people carried it out. The hadiths which explain the occurrence of Isra' are as follows: First: Anas bin Malik said that on the night of the Prophet's journey from the Masjidilharam, three people came to him at the time before the revelation, while the Apostle at that time was sleeping in the Masjidilharam. Then said the first, \"Who is he?\" Then the second person replied, \"He is the best among them (his people).\" After that the third person said, \"Take the best person.\" On that night the Prophet did not know who they were, so they came to the Prophet the other night with their eyes sleeping but their hearts were not sleeping. Thus the prophets, even though their eyes were closed, their hearts were not asleep. After that the group did not speak at all to the Prophet until they brought the Prophet and put him around the Zamzam well. Among them was Jibril who controlled the Prophet himself, then Jibril cut open a part of the body, from the neck to the heart, so that his chest was empty. After that Jibril washed the Prophet's heart with Zamzam water using his hands, so that his heart was clean. Then Jibril brought a golden vessel containing faith and wisdom. Then he poured the contents of the vessel into his chest and the veins of his throat and closed them again. (Al-Bukhari) Second: That the Prophet said, \"Suddenly a person (Gabriel) came to me. Then he opened my heart and took it out. After that, he brought me a vessel made of gold filled with faith, then he washed my heart. After that, he poured the contents of the vessel over to me. Then he returned my heart to the way it was before.\" (Al-Bukhari's history from Sa'sha'ah) Third: That the Messenger of Allah said, \"Buraq was brought to me, a white animal bigger than himar, and smaller than bigal. He stepped his feet as far as his eyes could see. Then I rode him, then he took me so that I reached Baitul Makdis. Then I tied him to the place where the prophets tied up their vehicles. Then I prayed two rak'ahs in it, then I came out. Then Jibril brought me a vessel filled with liquor (khamar) and another filled with milk; then I chose the one containing milk, then Jibril said, \"You have chosen fitrah as the right choice.\" (Ahmad's history from Anas bin Malik) From these hadiths, it can be concluded that the Prophet Muhammad traveled at night from the Grand Mosque to the Upper Aqsa Mosque permission of Allah under the guidance of the angel Jibril. Before the Prophet Muhammad was sent that night, his heart was filled with faith and wisdom, so that he could withstand pi all kinds of trials and steadfast in carrying out His commands. The journey was carried out by riding the Buraq which has extraordinary speed so that Isra' and Mi'raj only takes less than one night. In this verse it is not explained in detail, whether the Prophet Isra' with his spirit and body, or just his spirit. That is why the mufasir differed on this matter. The majority of them are of the opinion that Isra' is done with the spirit and body in a conscious state, not in a sleeping state. They put forward several reasons to strengthen their opinion, including: a. The word subhana denotes a great event. If the Prophet's isra' is in a sleeping state, there is no need to reveal it by using a verse preceded by tasbih. b. If Isra' had been done while sleeping, the Quraysh would not necessarily have denied it. The large number of Muslims who apostatized again because of the Isra' incident shows that this is not an ordinary event. Umm Hani's words that forbade the Prophet to tell anyone about his experiences during Isra' so that they would not think the Prophet was lying, also confirmed that Isra' was done by the Prophet with his spirit and body. This incident caused Abu Bakr to be given the title as-shiddiq because he confirmed the Prophet, quickly and without hesitation, to Isra' with his soul and body, while other people were hard to accept. c. The word of God which uses bi'abdihi shows that the Prophet Isra' with a spirit and body because the word servant refers to the unity of body and spirit. Ibn 'Abbas said that the Arabs used the word ru'ya in the sense of seeing with the eye, so the word ru'ya mentioned in the following word of Allah must be understood as seeing with the eyes. And We did not make the dream that We showed you, but as a test for mankind. (al-Isra'\/17: 60) e. What was shown to the Prophet at the time of Isra' and Mi'raj was eye vision which might occur because a similar speed has been proven by humans with modern technology. Some other commentators are of the opinion that Isra' was done by the Prophet with his spirit alone. They confirmed their opinion with the words of Mu'awiyah bin Abi Sufyan when asked about the Prophet Muhammad's Isra', he replied: The Prophet's Isra is a true dream that comes from Allah. The opinion that says that Isra' can only be done with the spirit is weak, because the sanad of hadith that is used as proof or guidance is not clear."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that Allah has sent down the Torah to Musa as as a guide for the life of the Children of Israel. Allah swt ordered Musa as to say to his people, \"Do not take other than Allah as a helper who provides protection and settles your affairs.\" The prohibition aimed at his people was a prohibition that had also been conveyed by the previous apostles through Allah's revelation. Also contained in the prohibition above is the command that humans worship only Allah and the prohibition of associating anything else with Him. There is also a prohibition on asking for help in all matters except from Him. Giving the book of the Torah to Prophet Musa as a guide for his people is to give understanding to Muslims, that among the duties of the apostles is conveying the religion of monotheism, as the Prophet's duty to them. Also to remind them not to imitate the attitude of the previous people, where after the death of the apostles, they made up tafsirs of Allah's words according to their will, and wallowed in the valley of sin and real error. That is why Allah swt mentions repeatedly in the Qur'an the privilege of Musa as and the advantages of the Children of Israel from other nations that existed at that time. Allah also mentions the favors given to them, with the intention that their consciences will be moved, then return to the right path, and live according to His instructions."

			"tafsir": "Allah swt also mentioned their ancestors, namely people whom Allah had saved together with Nuh as from a typhoon. They were saved by Allah through His revelation to Noah as Nuh was ordered to build a boat, so that he and his loyal people would avoid the punishment of Allah that would befall his people who denied his prophethood. This contains a warning for the Children of Israel to take examples and lessons from that event, and follow the path taken by Prophet Noah. This is also a lesson for Muslims to maintain monotheism like Noah and his followers, as well as people who are grateful for God's blessings. As an explanation of this tafsir, it is necessary to put forward several hadiths which explain that Prophet Noah as was a prophet who was very grateful for God's blessings, as mentioned in the hadith: First: Muadz bin Anas Al-Juhaniy narrated that Prophet Muhammad saw said, \"Verily Allah named Noah as servant who is very grateful for Allah's favors because when the time comes in the evening and in the morning, he says, Glory be to Allah when you are in the evening and at dawn and to Him be all praise in the heavens and the earth when it is in the evening and when you are at noon.\" (History of Ibn Mardawaih) Second: When Noah was wearing clothes and eating food he praised Allah. So he was called \"a servant who is very grateful for Allah's favors.\" the Muslims."

After repenting, they were released by Allah from this tribulation, their kingdom was returned, and they were given wealth and strength, both in terms of property, as well as strength in the field of lineage and national defense. However, they returned to causing trouble, so Allah swt re-deployed their enemies to destroy them. This is the punishment in this world, and in the hereafter they will get the punishment of hell. Among their defiance are: First, they do not heed God's commands and change the contents of the Torah. Second, their abomination in killing Zakaria and Yahya and their attempt to kill the Prophet Isa. They carried out this defiance by being arrogant and showing arrogance. This shows that the crimes they have committed have exceeded the limits of humanity. Allah then explained the consequences that would befall them, because of the first disobedience, that is, they would experience destruction when the punishment that Allah had promised arrived as a proper recompense for their crimes. It is also good to explain here, that the Children of Israel starting in 975 BC were divided into two kingdoms. First, the kingdom of Yahudza in the south, which consists of two tribes of the Children of Israel, namely the tribes of Yahudza and Benjamin. Its first king was Rehoboam, son of Prophet Sulaiman. Second, the kingdom of Israel in the north which consists of 10 other tribes. The first king named Jeroboam bin Nebat. In 70 BC the kingdom of Israel was attacked by the king of 'Assyria named Sanharib. This king could enter the city of Samurra, the capital of the Israelite kingdom, take the Israelites captive, and lead them to 'Assyria. Thus, the kingdom of the Children of Israel collapsed after living for 250 years. Due to the unrest of the Children of Israel, Allah sent the Babylonian army under the leadership of its king, Bukhtanashshar, also known as Nebuchadnezzar. This army expanded its land by killing, plundering, and robbing the inhabitants of the conquered lands. They attacked the Children of Israel, killed the scholars and officials from among them, damaged and burned the Torah books, and even destroyed their holy city, Baitul Makdis (Jerusalem). That was the fate that the Children of Israel suffered because they had deviated from the guidance of Allah's revelation, and tended to follow the will of their lusts. They even suffered an even worse fate, namely among the Children of Israel who were taken to Babylon. Three times they were taken prisoner by Nebuchadnezzar. The third and final captivity took place in 558 BC. As a result of Nebuchadnezzar's attack, the kingdom of Yahudza fell."

			"tafsir": "Then it was explained that Allah gave the people of Israel a turn to rule again. After Cyrus Kisra the first Persian of the Sasanian family was able to defeat Babylon, he freed the captives from the Children of Israel who were there, and sent them back to Palestine in 536 BC. Thus, the Israelites took control of their land again. God's gift was given to the Children of Israel when they had repented, obeyed the teachings of the Torah again, and realized the carelessness they had committed. They can rebuild their country and save their families and property. Thus, they returned to being an independent nation and could regain control of their country and become a strong and united nation as before, which they named the Jewish kingdom. It is because of Allah's forgiveness and mercy alone. This verse explains that as long as humans are under the guidance of revelation and walk according to His instructions, they will be able to experience the blessings Allah has provided in this world. They can also feel calm and happiness, peace of life, or the prosperity of the country. On the other hand, if humans deviate from the guidance of revelation and follow the desires of their own desires, they will certainly experience a bad fate. They no longer feel the favors that God has provided in this world, even those favors will turn into a disaster. They will not experience happiness and prosperity in social life, but will become people who are oppressed and expelled from their own country."

			"tafsir": "Allah emphasized that when the Children of Israel did good, then the results of that goodness were for themselves. However, the provisions contained in this verse are not specific to themselves, but generally apply to all humans at all times. Thus, if humans do good or do good, then the reward for that virtue will be felt, both in this world and in the hereafter. The good that they will receive in the world is that they will be a strong people defending themselves from the evil plans planned by their enemies. They will have the opportunity to multiply wealth as a means of life, and continue their descent as caliphs on earth. They will become a strong nation, which can embody a high culture to further excite their lives, and ensure the smooth running of their business and worship to Allah swt. Meanwhile, eternal happiness is heaven full of pleasures that are provided and promised to them, as proof of Allah's pleasure for the good they have done. If they do evil by committing acts that are contrary to the revelation and nature of their own events, such as opposing the truth and norms in their own way of life, then the result of their actions will be God's wrath against them. Thus, they will become a divided nation because they are enslaved by lust, so that one group tries to subdue the other group. That is why they cannot defend themselves and themselves against destruction and the evil intentions of the enemy. They will become an oppressed and colonized nation. While the bad that they will feel in the hereafter is the punishment of hell fire as the most painful torment. Then Allah revealed again the punishment as a result of the crime committed by the Children of Israel for the second time. At that time, Allah left them in a state of chaos when the enemies came to conquer them. This second defeat was truly incomparable to them and humiliated them. The enemy entered the Aqsa Mosque by force and arbitrarily to seize the wealth they had kept and destroy their religious symbols, as was done during the first conquest. Thus, they feel the suffering multiplied. They experienced material suffering in the form of loss of power, property, and women who were taken prisoner by the enemy. They also suffered moral suffering because the holy places and sacred symbols of their religion were violated and destroyed. According to history, it was the Romans who destroyed them for the second time, who then controlled Palestine. They killed and captured Jews and destroyed Baitul Makdis and other cities. The first Roman emperor to enter Baitul Makdis was Emperor Titus in 70 AD. He burned the Aqsa Mosque, and seized the valuables in it, so that in this event approximately 1 million Jews were killed. Furthermore, Emperor Hadrianus, who reigned from 117 to 158 AD, also controlled Baitul Makdis and carried out various acts of vandalism in the mosque. Hadrian turned this city into the Aelina Capitolian (city of Aelina). The Aqsa Mosque was torn down and a building was erected on it which was named Jupiter Capitolina. Then the Jewish kingdom was also destroyed so that the Jewish people had no kingdom anymore. They scattered all over the world. This event occurred in 132 AD."

			"tafsir": "Then Allah swt ordered them to be fully aware, repent, and adhere to the teachings of the Torah and stay away from immoral acts. Thus, Allah will bestow His mercy upon them. God's promise like this will certainly be fulfilled and they will definitely feel it. It is stated in history that in 614 AD, after 483 years after the destruction of Jerusalem by Hadrianus, the Persians under the leadership of Kisra Barwiz seized the cities in Palestine from the hands of the Romans. They fought the Romans against the Jews, and overturned the Christian custom of throwing garbage into Solomon's Temple. They also sold the Christians living in Jerusalem to the cities of the Jews, and burned their churches. Then in 624 AD, the Romans under the leadership of Emperor Heraclius I were able to retake Palestine from the hands of the Persians. In fact, Heraclius was able to enter the interior of the Persian empire, and put out the fire that the Persians worshiped. The victory of the Romans coincided with the victory of the Muslims in the battle of Badr against the polytheists of Mecca (Ramadan in 2 H) or January 624 AD, approximately 9 years after the Romans were defeated by the Persians. However, peace between the Romans and Persians only occurred in 928 AD, after Kisra Evermiz was killed by his own officers. In that year, all of Palestine was again under Roman rule and the cross was returned to Jerusalem. The Prophet Muhammad, who was sent since 610 AD as a prophet who brings mercy to the whole world, in 622 AD migrated to Medina. Upon arrival in Medina, he entered into an agreement with the Jews in that city. This agreement is known as the Medina Charter. Its contents stated that the Jews were residents of the city of Medina besides the Ansar and Emigrants. They were allowed to continue to adhere to their religion. However, they betrayed and staged a plot to kill the Prophet. They were then fought by the Prophet, and some of them were expelled from Medina, namely Bani Nadhir. After Umar bin Khaththab became caliph, he conquered the land of Sham (Suria) in 636 AD. The inhabitants of Jerusalem (Baitul Makdis) under the leadership of Patrip Suverianus surrendered the city to him, and a peace charter was agreed and signed by both parties. Umar bin Khaththab then built a mosque in the Qibla of the Aqsa Mosque (Sulaeman's Temple), and cleaned the city of Jerusalem. So the city of Jerusalem that had been lost all this time reappeared in glory. After the entire Syam country including Palestine fell into the hands of the Muslims, the Roman Emperor Heraclius I climbed a hill and faced Syria. Then he waved his hand saying, \"Farewell Suria forever.\" Thus, the Jewish nation was released from the clutches, persecution, and oppression of the Romans. They were again free to worship around the Sulaiman Temple (Aqsa Mosque). This is a mercy from Allah the Almighty. Such is the description mentioned in the history books. As for the Qur'an, it is not explained in detail, because the Qur'an is not a history book. Meanwhile, Allah SWT continues to remind them that if they repeat their disobedience, as was done by their forefathers, Allah SWT will surely bring down His punishment again with a more painful one. In addition, Allah provides the punishment of the fires of Hell as an eternal prison for them in the hereafter, because that is the punishment that is appropriate for those who do not want to believe."

Send down anathema to me, destroy me!\" They pronounce it as when praying to Allah with a good prayer, so that he will be given health and safety will be bestowed on him, his descendants and his property. If Allah swt had granted their ugly prayer, they would not have been able to avoid the consequences. However, Allah swt did not do that. This is nothing but because of the great love of Allah. Allah swt said: And if Allah hastens evil for humans as they request to hasten good, their age will surely end. (Yunus\/10: 11) At the end of the verse, Allah SWT explains that humans have a hasty nature. If he wants something according to his heart's desire, his mind is closed to judge what he wants, whether it is beneficial for him or harmful. It is solely driven by the nature of haste to achieve its goals, without thinking it through beforehand. This shows that in general humans are interested in the outward state of something without examining more deeply the nature and secrets of that thing. In this verse there is satire against the Arab polytheists who deny the truth of the Qur'an, because they do not want to believe in the existence of the Day of Judgment. They prefer the world they can enjoy directly, rather than thinking about the promises and threats they will receive on the Day of Judgment."

			"tafsir": "Then Allah SWT explains the signs of His power in the universe, with the intention that humans think about and reflect on all of His creations in this world. Allah swt explained that He created the night and the day, each as a sign of His power. Day and night are two events that always alternate which are very useful for the benefit of human life in carrying out religious obligations and worldly affairs. Such regular changes are a very clear sign of Allah's power to man. Anyone who pays attention and thinks about the alternation of day and night is sure that this universe is regulated by very good and precise rules, and also shows that the organizers are very thorough. Thus, humans will be guided to acknowledge the existence of a Creator of this universe and all in it. In addition, the alternation of day and night is a gift that humans can experience directly in their daily lives. At night they can rest to relieve fatigue. Allah also makes the signs of the coming night, namely the disappearance of the sun's light from the western horizon, so that over time it becomes completely dark. This is a sign of His power. God makes a bright day as a sign of His power to give people the opportunity to seek the necessities of life for themselves and their families. On the other hand, the change of day and night is very useful for humans to know the number of years, months and days and their calculations, except in the north and south polar regions. In the Qur'an, Allah not only informs people about His creation, but also gives indications for using it for human welfare. In relation to the sun and moon, Allah gave very clear instructions that day and night, or in other words the circulation of the sun and moon, would be very useful to be used as a benchmark in making a calendar or calendar. The verse that clearly states the calendar is verse 36 of surahh at-Taubah\/9, which reads as follows: \"Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months, according to Allah's decree when He created the heavens and the earth, among which there are four forbidden months. . That is the true religion.......\" Another similar verse is verse 5 of surahh Yunus\/10: \"It is He who makes the sun shine and the moon shine, and it is He who determines the places of their orbits, so that you know the number of years , and the calculation of time ............\" Day and night occur due to the rotation of the earth on its axis which moves from west to east, which gives the impression to humans as if the sun is moving from east to west. When the sun appears on the eastern horizon it is called afternoon and when the sun sets on the western horizon it is called evening. From sunset one time, until sunset the next day, it is called one day and one night according to the customs and assumptions in the calculation of the qamariah year. But in the lunar year, what is called one day and one night is the time from mid-night to the middle of the following night. By emphasizing the alternation of day and night as the basis for knowing the number of years and calculating them in the hope of Allah's priority, it is clear that this verse implies the flexibility of the Islamic calendar. A calendar system based on the alternation of days and nights is based solely on the (apparent) movement of the sun around the earth. This system does not involve the movement of the moon with respect to the earth. This is a solar calendar system (solar year) which states that one year equals 365 plus a quarter of the night and day and vice versa. Therefore, according to this system, one year has 365 days for basithah years and 366 days for leap years. In general, one Islamic year is the length of time from January 1 to December 31. The calculation is based on the time it takes the earth to go around the sun. This calendar system is identical to the AD year which is now widely used in international relations. One year in the qamariah year calculation is the length of time from the 1st of Muharram to the 30th of Zulhijjah, which is 354 days for basithah years or 355 days for leap years. This kind of calculation is called urfi reckoning. Calculation of the qamariah year is based on the circulation of the moon around the earth. From the crescent to the next crescent it is called 1 month, and if there have been 12 crescents it is considered to have even one qamariah year. This verse emphasizes that the Gregorian calendar system or the Syamsiah year may be used by Muslims in international relations, especially in carrying out transactions and business (muamalah) as usual with any community nationally. The Hijri calendar system, which is a limited lunar year, can be used to determine the times of worship, namely the timing of 1 Ramadan, 1 Shawwal and 10 Zulhijah. There is no need to force the use of this Hijri year for muamalah life in daily interactions and transactions nationally and internationally. In fact, the Christian calendar or year is also used to determine other times of worship, namely prayer times, because this prayer time is completely determined by the (apparent) movement of the sun and has absolutely nothing to do with the movement of the moon around the earth. So even though there are verses in the Qur'an which imply the use of the Hijri year (which incidentally is the qamariah year) this verse confirms Allah's commandment to use any solar year for muamalah and in general for association with other people."

			"tafsir": "Allah swt explained that each human being recorded his deeds in a notebook and remained recorded in it like a necklace that remained around their necks. These deeds include good deeds and bad deeds, big or small, which humans do on the basis of their own choices. The parable of the persistence of their notes in the book with the constant necklaces on people's necks, as an allegory that the records will be preserved, will not be lost or erased, and will always be attributed to someone. Furthermore, Allah swt emphasized that the book containing the records of human deeds will be removed from his savings on the Day of Resurrection, and will be shown to them, so that they can know its contents openly. In another verse it is explained that the task of recording human deeds is taken care of by angels. Allah swt says: And verily for you there are (angels) who watch over (your work), who are noble (with Allah) and who record (your deeds), they know what you do. (al-Infithar\/82: 10-12) The following hadith of the Prophet Muhammad explains more clearly the same thing: It was narrated from Al-Hasan that the Messenger of Allah said, \"Allah said to the Children of Adam, \"O Children of Adam! We have opened the pages of the Book, and have appointed two glorious angels as representatives: one on the right, and one on the left. As for the one on the right, his job is to record your good deeds, while the one on the left is to record your bad deeds. So do as you like, a lot or a little, until death comes to take you. And when you are dead, I fold the pages of the book and tie them around your neck and remain with you in your grave until the Day of Judgment. On that day, the book will be taken out and you will find it open. Read the book of records, surely on that day you will know that the book is sufficient as a reckoning for your deeds.

That is why Allah swt confirms at the end of the verse that it is sufficient on that day that they themselves are the reckoning for their deeds. This means that all the records contained in the book are accurate enough as evidence because what is recorded in the book is a record of their deeds. It was as if they had made the notes themselves. Allah's Word: And put the book (charity record), then you will see the sinners are afraid of what is (written) in it, and they say, \"How unfortunate we are, what book is this, there is nothing left, the small and great but everything is recorded,\" and they find (all) what they have done (written). And your Lord does not wrong anyone. (al-Kahf\/18: 49) Thus, there is no need for other evidence as reinforcement because all the scratched notes in the book are very convincing evidence, so that it cannot be added or subtracted."

			"tafsir": "In a history originating from Ibn 'Abbas it is stated that this verse was revealed regarding Walid bin Mugirah when he said to the people of Mecca, \"Reject Muhammad and I will bear your sins.\" In this verse, Allah swt emphasizes that whoever acts according to Allah's guidance and the guidance of the Prophet, namely carrying out His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, means that he has acted to save himself. He will get a record of his good deeds in his book. He will feel happy because he will get Allah's pleasure, and receive abundant rewards, namely heaven with various pleasurahble pleasures. However, whoever goes astray, namely people who deviate from the guidance of the Qur'an, will suffer losses. He will get a record of his bad deeds in the book. He will feel remorse that is useless and will be sent to hell, as a reward he deserves. Furthermore, Allah swt confirms that on that day a person who sins cannot bear the sins of others. Each person is responsible for his own bad deeds, so it is impossible for someone to be burdened with sins other than his own. They will receive a charitable reward according to the severity of the crime they have committed. If a person is tortured for misleading others, so that he is sentenced according to the sins of the person being misled, it does not mean that the person who is misleading is bearing the sins of the person being misled. However, the person who misleads is considered a sin because he misleads others. Therefore, he was punished according to his own sins, plus the sin of misleading people. Allah swt says: (Their words) cause them on the Day of Judgment to bear their own sins perfectly, and some of the sins of those they misled who do not know in the least (that they are being led astray). (an-Nahl\/16: 25) And the word of Allah: And they will surely bear their own sins, and other sins with their sins. (al-'Ankabut\/29: 13) At the end of this verse, it is stated that Allah will not punish a person or a people before sending an apostle. This means that Allah will not impose punishment on those who commit an act except after sending an apostle to read and explain the provisions of the punishment. Thus, this verse is seen as the principle of legality in Islamic crime. That is, all actions that are punishable by punishment must first be promulgated through statutory means that can guarantee that these regulations can be known by all the people. It also means that socialization of legislation is important. This verse also implies that Allah will not destroy the people because of their sins, before sending a messenger who warns them and conveys Allah's law to them, and gives threats if they disobey and persist in their disobedience. Allah swt says: Every time a group (unbelievers) are thrown into it, the guards (of hell) ask them, \"Has there never been anyone who came to warn you (in the world)?\" They replied, \"Yes, indeed, a warner has come to us, but we deny (it) and we say, \"Allah did not send down anything, you are actually in great error.\" (al-Mulk \/ 67: 8 -9) And He said: Did We not extend your life to be able to think for those who want to think, even though a warner has come to you? So feel (Our punishment), and for the wrongdoers there is no helper. Fathir\/35: 37)"

But in the hereafter, they will get nothing but the punishment of hell. This statement is addressed to people who do not believe in the existence of the resurrection day and the day of judgment, so they believe that there is no life after life in this world. That is why they are too greedy for the wealth of the world and its luxuries, even though the life of this world and its pleasures are temporary. Therefore, life in the world and its luxuries are described by Allah as something that can be obtained and felt immediately, but soon it will also be destroyed and ended. Allah's Word: And let those who disbelieve think that the grace period which We have given them is better for them. Indeed, the grace period that We have given them is only so that their sins will increase; and they will have a humiliating punishment. (ali 'Imran\/3: 178) Then Allah swt threatened them with the threat of hell as a proper reward for them. In this world, they will experience deep sadness because they are separated from the luxuries of the world they love so much when death comes.

There is a will to do an act by prioritizing the afterlife happiness above worldly interests. 2. Doing good deeds as a manifestation of his intention to get happiness in the afterlife by obeying God's commands and always drawing closer to Him. 3.

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah commands all human beings, so that they pay attention to several factors related to faith. These factors are: First, so that humans do not worship gods other than Allah. Included in the notion of worshiping gods other than Allah is believing in the existence of other powers that can affect the soul and body apart from those that come from Allah. All existing objects, visible or invisible, are God's creatures. Therefore, the one who deserves the highest respect is only the One who created nature and all that is in it. It is He who gives life and enjoyment to all His creatures. So if there is a human being who worships objects or supernatural powers other than Allah, it means that he has gone astray, because all these objects are His creatures, who have no power to provide benefits and are powerless to resist harm, so they have no right to be worshiped. Second, so that people do good to their parents and their parents. The mention of this commandment after the command to worship only Allah has the intention that humans understand how important it is to do good to their parents. It also means that they are grateful for the kindness of the two mothers and fathers, how much suffering they have felt, both during childbirth and when they had difficulty in earning a living, caring for and educating children with love. So it is appropriate if doing good to both mothers and fathers is made the most important obligation among other obligations, and Allah places it in second place after the obligation of humans to worship only Him. Allah said: And worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him. And do good to both parents. (an-Nisa'\/4: 36) On the other hand, a child who is disobedient to his parents is declared a person who commits immorality, whose sin is placed second, after the sins of those who associate partners with Allah with other gods. Allah swt said: Say (Muhammad), \"Let me read what God has forbidden you. Do not associate anything with Him, and do good to your parents. (al-An'am\/6: 151) Allah commands mankind to do good to both parents for the following reasons: 1. The love and effort of the two mothers and fathers have been poured out on their children so that they become pious children and avoid going astray. that is peerless, and the efforts that do not know painstakingly are rewarded by their children by treating them well and being grateful for their good services. 2. Children are the soul mates of both mothers and fathers. 3. From infancy to adulthood, the growth and education of children is the responsibility of both parents. So children should respect and do good to their parents. In short it can be said that the most favors received by humans is the grace of God, after that the favors received from both parents. They are also the second cause of children, while Allah is the first (essential) cause. That is why Allah SWT places the obligation to do good to parents in second place after the obligation for humans to worship only Allah. After that Allah swt determined that if one of the two parents or both were old, so that they experienced physical weakness, and it was no longer possible to try to make a living, they had to live together with their children, in order to get a living and protection. It is the duty of their children to treat them with love and patience, and to respect them as gratitude for the blessings they have received from both of them. In this verse there are several provisions and manners that must be observed by children towards their parents, including: 1. A child may not say dirty and rude words even if it is only an \"ah\" word to his parents, because of their bad attitude or actions. not liked. Such a situation should be treated patiently, as was treated by his parents when caring for and educating him when he was young. 2. A child may not scold or snap at his parents, because that yelling will hurt the feelings of both of them. To rebuke both parents is to issue harsh words when the child rejects or blames their opinion, because it is not in accordance with his opinion. The prohibition on rebuking in this verse is a reinforcement of the prohibition on saying \"ah\" which is usually uttered by a child to his parents when he disagrees with their opinion. 3. Let the child speak noble words to both parents. Noble words are words that are kind and spoken with great respect, which describe polite manners and full respect for others. Therefore, if a child has a difference of opinion with his parents, he should still show a polite and respectful attitude. (24) Then Allah swt ordered the Muslims to be humble and full of love for both parents. What is meant by being humble in this verse is obeying what they order as long as the order does not conflict with religious provisions. Obedience of children to both parents is a sign of affection and respect for them, especially when both of them really need their child's help. It is emphasized that humility must be done with love, not contrived to cover up reproaches or to avoid embarrassment to others. This humble attitude should really be carried out because of the awareness that arises from the conscience. At the end of the verse, Allah swt orders Muslims to pray for their parents, so that they will be given an abundance of Allah's love as a reward for their love in educating them when they were children. There are several hadiths of the Prophet that command Muslims to serve their parents and their mothers: It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that a man had actually come to the Prophet asking permission to be allowed to fight with him, then the Prophet said, \"Is are your parents still alive?\" The man replied, \"Yes.\" The Prophet said, \"Then do your jihad by being devoted to your parents.\" (History of Muslim and al-Bukhari in chapter al-adab) A child is not considered to repay the services of his parents, unless he finds them in a state of slavery, then he redeems them and frees them. (Muslim and other narrations from Abu Hurairah) I asked the Messenger of Allah, \"Which deed is the most beloved to Allah and His Messenger?\" The Messenger of Allah replied, \"Perform the prayer on time.\" I asked, \"Then which charity again?\" The Prophet replied, \"Do good to both mothers and fathers.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrations from Ibn Mas'ud) In the verse interpreted above, it is not explained who should get filial piety between the two parents. However, in a hadith it is explained that serving the mother takes precedence over the father, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim: It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"Who is most deserving of the best treatment from me?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\" The person asked, \"Who else?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\" The person asked, \"Who else?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your mother.\" The person asked, \"Who else?\" The Prophet replied, \"Your father.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Devoted to both parents, is not enough to do while they are still alive, but continues even though both have died. The procedure is mentioned in a hadith narrated by Ibn Majah: That the Messenger of Allah was asked, \"Is there still a service for my parents, after they died?\" Rasulullah SAW replied, \"Yes, there are still four things, praying for parents to Allah, asking forgiveness for them, fulfilling their promises, and respecting their friends and connecting kinship ties with people who have no family relationship with them. you except from their side. Then this is the remaining service that you must perform, as a service to them after they die.\" (History of Ibn Majah from Abu Usaid)"

If there are close relatives, or poor people and people on the way who need expenses for their living needs, then they should be given sufficient assistance to meet their needs. People who are on a journey whose suffering should be alleviated are people who travel for purposes justified by religion. People in such circumstances need to be assisted and assisted in order to achieve their goals. At the end of the verse, Allah SWT forbids Muslims to be extravagant, namely spending wealth without careful calculation so that it becomes redundant. This prohibition is intended for Muslims to regulate their expenses with the most careful calculations, so that what is spent is in accordance with their needs and income. Muslims are also not allowed to give away wealth to people who are not entitled to receive it, or give more wealth than it should. Further information about how Muslims should spend their wealth is mentioned in the word of Allah SWT: And (including the servants of God the Most Merciful) those who, when spending (wealth), are not extravagant, and are not (also) stingy, among both reasonable. (al-Furqan\/25: 67) As for the information explaining the meaning contained in the verse about the prohibition of extravagance which means wasteful, it can be seen in the hadiths of the Prophet as follows: It was narrated from Abdullah bin Umar, he said, \"The Messenger of Allah met Saad at the time of ablution, then the Messenger of Allah said, \"How wasteful is your ablution, O Saad!\" Saad said, \"Is there any waste in ablution?\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"Yes, even though you are in a flowing river.\" (Ibn Majah's History) Anas bin Malik that he said, \"There came a man from Bani Tamim to the Messenger of Allah and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I am a wealthy person, many families, children and guests who are always present, so explain to me how I should spend treasure, and how should I do.\" So the Messenger of Allah said, \"If you have wealth, pay zakat out of your wealth, because zakat is actually a purification that purifies you, maintain friendship with your relatives, and you should know about the rights of people who ask for help, neighbors and the poor. Then the man said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you reduce this obligation to me?\" The Messenger of Allah recited the verse: And give dues to close relatives, also to the poor and people on the way; and do not squander (your wealth) extravagantly. Then the man said, \"That is enough for me O Messenger of Allah, when I have paid zakat to your amil zakat, then I have been free from the obligation of zakat that must be paid to Allah and His Messenger,\" then the Messenger of Allah said, \"Yes, if you have paid zakat to my amil, you are free from that obligation and you will receive the reward, and the person who replaces it with another will sin.\" (Ahmad's history)"

The Quraysh polytheists also used their wealth to hinder the spread of Islam, weaken its adherents, and help the enemies of Islam. The verse goes down to reveal how bad their business is."

Allah explains the condition of people who are miserly and spendthrift by using the expression do not make your hands shackled around your neck, but also do not stretch them too much. These two expressions are commonly used by Arabs. The first means the prohibition of being miserly or miserly, so that you are reluctant to give wealth to other people, even if it's a little. The second expression means to prohibit people from being extravagant in spending wealth, so that it exceeds what they have. The habit of wasting wealth will result in a person not having savings or savings that can be used when needed. From this verse it can be understood that a good way to spend wealth is in a way that is frugal, proper and reasonable, not too stingy and not too extravagant. Too miserly will make someone disgraceful, while being too extravagant will result in bankruptcy or bankruptcy. The information obtained from the traditions of the Prophet can be put forward as follows: Imam Ahmad and other experts on hadith narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said: The person who is thrifty will not become poor. This hadith explains the importance of being frugal, so the Prophet said that people who are always thrifty will not become a burden to others or become poor. Imam al-Baihaqi narrated a hadith from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said: Be frugal in spending wealth, half of life."

Everything goes according to the provisions that Allah has set for His servants in the search for wealth and how to develop it. This is closely related to tools and knowledge about processing the treasure. This is Allah's provision which is general in nature and applies to all of His servants. However, only Allah determines according to His will. At the end of this verse, Allah swt confirms that He is All-Knowing of His servants, which of them use wealth for benefit and who uses it for harm. He also knows which of His servants are in poverty who remain patient and trust Allah, and who because of poverty, become hopeless people, and are far from Allah's mercy. Allah is All-Seeing of how they manage and manage their property, whether they spend the wealth that God has given them lavishly or miserly. Therefore, Muslims should stick to the provisions of Allah, by obeying all His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. In spending assets should be reasonable. It is included in the sunnah of Allah."

			"tafsir": "Then Allah swt forbade the Muslims to kill their children, as was done by some tribes from the Arab Jahiliah nation. They bury their daughters because they are considered unable to earn sustenance, and only become a burden in life. In contrast to boys who are considered to have the ability to find wealth, fight, and maintain family honor. Girls are seen as only bringing shame because they can cause poverty and degrade the family's dignity by marrying someone who is not their equal. Especially in war, girls would certainly become prisoners, so it was not impossible that they would suffer the humiliating fate of being slaves. Therefore, Allah swt forbids Muslims to imitate these Jahiliah habits, by giving the reason that sustenance is in His power. He is the one who provides sustenance for them. If He has the power to give sustenance to boys, then He also has the power to give it to girls. Allah stated that fear of poverty was not a reason to kill their daughters. At the end of this verse, Allah swt confirms that killing children is a big sin, because it hinders the purpose of human life. Not allowing the child to live means severing offspring, which also means wiping out human life itself from the face of the earth. The following hadith of the Prophet saw illustrates how great the sin of killing a child is: It was narrated from 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud that he asked, \"O Messenger of Allah, which is the greatest sin? The Messenger of Allah replied, \"If you make partners for Allah, even though Allah created you .\" I asked again, \"Then which other sin?\" Rasulullah SAW answered him, \"If you kill your child because you are afraid that the child will eat with you.\" I asked again, \"Then which other sin?\" Rasulullah SAW replied, \"You committed adultery with your neighbour's wife.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) In addition, it can be said that the act of killing a child out of fear of starvation is a form of prejudice against Allah. , because it leads to efforts to destroy the continuity of human existence in the world. Apart from exposing the evil habits of the Arabs in i during the Jahiliyyah, this verse also reveals their very curmudgeonly character."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah SWT prohibits His servants from approaching adultery. The intention is to commit acts that lead to adultery, such as promiscuity without control between men and women, reading stimulating literature, watching soap operas and films that indulge in female sensuality, and the spread of pornography and pornography. All of that really is a conducive situation for the occurrence of adultery. The prohibition of committing adultery is expressed by a prohibition against approaching adultery to give a firm impression, that if even approaching adultery is prohibited, what else is there to do. With disclosure like this, someone will be able to understand that the prohibition of committing adultery is a strict prohibition, so it really must be avoided. What is meant by an act of adultery is sexual intercourse committed by a man and a woman outside of marriage, whether the man or woman has had legal sexual relations or not, and not because of any mistake. Furthermore, Allah gives reasons why adultery is prohibited. The reason mentioned at the end of this verse is because adultery is truly an abominable act that results in a lot of damage, including: 1. Damage to the lineage, which causes a person to doubt the lineage of his child, whether the child born is his descendant or the result of adultery. The husband's allegation that his wife had committed adultery with another man resulted in various difficulties, such as divorce and difficulties in the child's education and legal status. Such a situation causes disruption to the growth of the child's soul and destroys the social order. 2. Causing shock and anxiety in society, because honor is not maintained. How many killings have occurred in society because members of that community have committed adultery. 3. Damaging the peace of married life. The good name of a woman or man who has committed adultery will be tarnished in society. The serenity of married life will never materialize, and the loving relationship between husband and wife will be damaged. 4. Destroying the household. The wife is not solely as a gratification of lust, but as a life partner in the household and fostering household welfare. Therefore, if the husband is responsible for meeting household needs, then the wife is responsible for maintaining it, both property and children and the orderliness of the household. So if the wife or husband is tarnished by adultery, the destruction of the household is difficult to avoid. 5. The spread of adultery in society has led to the development of various venereal diseases such as syphilis (lion king). In addition, it also increases the spread of AIDS or diseases that destroy the sufferer's immune system, so that he will die slowly. In short, it can be stated that the act of adultery is a very heinous act, which causes the destruction of lineage, creates shock and anxiety in society, destroys the peace of married life, destroys the household itself, and demeans human dignity. If the act is allowed to run rampant in the midst of society, it means that humans are on the same level as animals. This verse contains a prohibition on committing adultery and hints at the extravagant behavior of the Arab Jahiliyyah. Adultery is a cause of waste."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah forbids His servant from killing a soul that Allah has forbidden. The meaning of \"killing souls\" is to take human lives. Meanwhile, what is meant by \"those whom Allah has forbidden to kill\" is killing for reasons that are not legal or that are not justified by religion. As for the reasons why Allah SWT forbids His servants to take human lives for reasons that are not justified, they are: 1. Murder causes damage. Islam prohibits any action that causes damage. The prohibition applies generally to all kinds of actions that cause damage, so even killing includes prohibited actions. Allah swt said: ¦ do not do damage on earth after (created) well. (al-A'raf\/7: 85) 2. Murder endangers other people. The main provision in religion is that all actions that cause harm to oneself and others are prohibited. Allah swt said: ¦that whoever kills someone, not because that person killed another person, or not because he did damage to the earth, it is as if he has killed all humans. (al-Ma'idah\/5: 32) The Messenger of Allah said: The loss of the world for Allah is of lesser value than killing a Muslim. (History of at-Tirmidhi from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar) 3. Disturbing the security of the community which leads to the destruction of the community itself. Because if killing is allowed, it is not impossible that there will be acts of mutual killing between humans, which in the end the humans will perish. And whoever kills a believer on purpose, then the reward will be hell, he will abide therein forever. Allah was angry with him, and cursed him and prepared a great punishment for him. (an-Nisa'\/4: 93) In this verse Allah swt provides an exception who may be killed through His word, \"except for a reason that is justified by religion.\" Among them are men or women who commit adultery after being bound by a legal marriage contract and people who intentionally kill a believer who is protected by law. Exceptions as mentioned above, mentioned in the hadith of the Prophet: It is not lawful for the blood of a person who has uttered two sentences of creed, except for one of three cases: a person killed because he killed, a widow or widower who commits adultery, and a person who abandons his religion separates himself from the Muslims. (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from 'Abdullah) Then Allah swt explained what action must be taken by the heir of the murdered person, and who should carry out this action if by chance the murdered person has no heirs. Allah swt stipulates that whoever is killed unjustly, i.e. without good reason, Allah has given authority or rights to his heirs to determine the choice of punishment for the killer, namely between qishash law or receiving diyat (ransom), as has been stipulated in His words: O you who believe! It is obligatory upon you (to carry out) qisas regarding the person who was killed. (al-Baqarah\/2: 178). (see further tafsir of this verse in volume I). And the words of the Prophet Muhammad during the conquest of Mecca: Whoever kills, the family of the murdered is given the right to choose between two things, if they want, they can demand the death penalty, and if they want, they can demand a diyat (ransom). (History of Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i from Abu Syuraih al-Khuza'i) Then if by chance the person killed has no heirs, then the one who acts in his place in determining the choice of punishment is the ruler. In this case the ruler may delegate his powers to the local qadhi (judges), if deemed necessary. In carrying out qishash, the rulers who were authorized to carry it out were ordered not to exceed the specified limits, as had happened in the Jahiliyya era. People in the Age of Jahiliyyah were not satisfied with simply avenging the death of the person who killed them, but also demanded the death of other people, if the person killed was from among the nobility. If the person killed was an aristocrat, while the person who killed was from among the common people, then the death demanded from the nobility would also serve as a substitute for the killer himself. In verse 178 of surahh al-Baqarah there is a strong indication that the most important punishment for the family of the murdered person is simply to demand diyat or pardon, not to seek revenge for death. At the end of the verse, Allah SWT explains that heirs or rulers in carrying out kisas punishment may not exceed their limits because they receive Allah's help, in the form of retribution to choose kisas punishment or diyat punishment. Therefore, judges should be guided by these provisions in deciding cases. Do not decide matters that are contrary to God's rules or exceed the applicable provisions. This verse is classified as a Makkiyah verse and is included in the first verse of the law that was revealed. Thus, it is natural that this verse only regulates the law for murder in general. The detailed information is regulated in other verses, the tafsir of which has been presented in volume I."

Approaching the orphan's property means using the orphan's property in the wrong place or not providing protection for the property, so that it is wasted. Allah swt provides protection for orphans' assets because they really need it, while he has not been able to take care of his wealth, and has not been able to make a living for himself. However, Allah swt provides an exception, namely if it costs money to maintain the property, or with the intention of developing it, then it is permissible for the person who takes care of the orphan to take some of it in a reasonable way. Therefore, it is necessary to have someone who is responsible for taking care of the orphan's property. The person in charge of carrying it out is called a washiy (custodian) and an agency or institution that takes care of the orphan's assets is also needed. These agencies or institutions should be supervised by the government for their activities, so that there is no misuse or diversion of the orphan's assets. Then in this verse it is explained that if the orphan is an adult and has the ability to manage and develop his property, it means that it is time for the property to be handed back by the guardian to him. After the verse was revealed, the companions of the Prophet who cared for the orphans were afraid, so they did not want to eat or associate with them. Therefore, Allah revealed this verse: And if you associate with them, then they are your brothers. Allah knows those who do evil and those who do good. (al-Baqarah\/2: 220) From this verse it is clear that it is forbidden to spend the assets of orphans when used for personal gain. However, if it is spent for the maintenance of the property itself, or for the needs of orphans, and the guardian is truly a person who cannot afford it, then this is not prohibited. Allah swt said: And do not eat it (the orphan's wealth) beyond the limits of decency and (do not be) in a hurry (hand it over) before they grow up. Whoever (among the caregivers) is able, then let him refrain (from eating the orphan's wealth) and whoever is poor, then he may eat the treasure according to the proper way. (an-Nisa'\/4: 6) Allah swt commands His servants to fulfill promises, both promises to Allah and promises made to fellow human beings, namely buying and selling contracts and leasing contracts which are included in the field of muamalah. Az-Zajjaj explained that all of Allah's commands and His prohibitions are promises of Allah that must be fulfilled, including promises that must be made to their Lord, and promises made between servants and servants. What is meant by fulfilling a promise is carrying out what has been stipulated in the agreement, by not deviating from the provisions of the applicable religion and law. At the end of the verse, Allah swt confirms that in fact the promise must be accounted for. People who betray their promises, or cancel their promises unilaterally will receive appropriate retribution."

The point is that when measuring goods it should be done as accurately and as carefully as possible. Therefore, someone who measures merchandise that will be handed over to someone else after being sold may not reduce the measure because it harms other people. Likewise, if someone measures other people's merchandise that he will receive after purchase, it should not be exaggerated, because it will also harm other people. Allah swt also ordered them to weigh goods with the correct balance (scales) and in accordance with established standards. A correct balance is a balance that is prepared as accurately as possible, so that it can give confidence to the person making the sale and purchase, and does not allow fraudulent additions and subtractions. Allah swt threatens those who reduce these measures and weights with harsh threats. Allah swt said: Woe to those who cheat (in measuring and weighing)! (That is) people who when they receive a measure from other people they ask for it to be fulfilled, and when they measure or weigh it (for other people), they reduce it. (al-Muthaffifin\/83: 1-3) At the end of the verse, Allah SWT explains that measuring or weighing goods carefully will have better consequences for them because in this world they gain the trust of members of the community, and in the hereafter they will receive a reward from Allah and His good pleasure, and avoid the fire of hell."

Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Do not testify, except what you have seen with your eyes, what you hear with your ears. , and what the heart knows with full awareness.\" 2. Qatadah said, \"Do not say, \"I have heard,\" when you have not heard, and do not say, \"I have seen,\" when you have not seen, and do not say, \"I have known,\" when you have not know.\" 3. Another opinion says that what is meant by the prohibition of saying something that one does not know is saying that is only based on prejudice and conjecture, not true knowledge, as stated in the word of Allah: O you who believe! Stay away from prejudice, in fact some prejudice is a sin. (al-Hujurat\/49: 12) And as mentioned in the hadith: Stay away from prejudice, in fact prejudice is the most lying statement. (History of Muslim, Ahmad, and at-Tirmizi from Abu Hurairah) 4. There are also those who think that what is meant is a prohibition against polytheists following the beliefs of their ancestors, with blind obedience and following the desires of lust. Among them is following the beliefs of their ancestors in worshiping idols, and giving these idols various names, as stated in the word of Allah: These are nothing but names that you and your ancestors invented. (an-Najm\/53: 23) Allah swt then said that actually hearing, sight, and the heart will be asked, whether what someone says is in accordance with what the voice of his heart hears. If what is said is in accordance with what is heard, seen, and the voice of his heart, he is safe from the threat of the fire of hell, and will receive a reward and the pleasure of Allah.

Even from the point of view of psychology, a person who usually walks with pride means that there is a weakness in his soul. He feels inferior, so to cover up his weakness, he walks arrogantly and shows off with the intention of attracting the attention of others. Allah swt confirms that they will never be able to penetrate the earth and match the height of a mountain.

How is it possible that Allah SWT, who created the heavens and the earth and the things that are between them, is said to have daughters who are angels, while they themselves prefer to have sons and hate daughters. They even buried the daughter alive. In this case, they attribute to Allah a quality that they themselves do not like. Their way of thinking is completely messed up. They attribute the Supreme One and Noble Substance to a lowly nature in their own eyes. Such an assumption results in three kinds of errors. 1. They think that the angels are daughters. 2. They assume that angels are daughters of God. 3. They worshiped the angels. Allah swt said: So ask (Muhammad) to them (the disbelievers of Mecca), \"Are the daughters for your Lord while they are for the sons?\" Or did We create angels in the form of women while they witnessed (it)? Remember, among their lies they actually said, \"God had a son.\" And really, they are total liars. (ash-shaffat\/37: 149-152) Allah swt confirms that by saying that, the polytheists have said a big sin. They have fabricated lies against God, and are therefore threatened with painful punishments. They have also wasted their own minds, because they distort the truth that they should uphold. And they said, \"(Allah) the Most Gracious begot a son.\" Verily, you have brought something very unlawful, almost to the point that the heavens were split open, and the earth was split open, and the mountains fell, (because of that saying), because they thought (Allah) the Most Compassionate had a child.

The seven heavens, the earth, and all the creatures in it glorify and glorify His name, and witness the proofs of His oneness. There is not a single creature but glorifies by praising Him. Anyone who wants to pay attention to the creatures or objects around him will certainly know that both living things and inanimate objects are entirely subject to and subject to Allah's decrees or provisions which cannot be avoided. An example is the law of attraction (gravity). This law applies in general and affects all existing objects, whether they are gases, liquids, solids, or living things. Everything is affected by the law of attraction. This shows that the law of attraction which has such great power and influence cannot just happen by chance, but rather someone creates and controls it all the time. The Creator is certainly the Almighty and Almighty, namely Allah swt. This law of attraction is enough proof that all objects and creatures that exist on this earth are subject to and subject to the laws and provisions of Allah. If someone wants to escape from the influence of the gravitational force (gravity) of the earth, he must use science that can free him from this attraction. In order to master that knowledge, he must master the law of action and reaction, that is, action that can overcome the gravitational force of the earth, so that he can escape the influence of its force. The success of a person in escaping from the force of gravity does not mean that he is not subject to God's law, but that he can free himself because he is subject to other laws of nature. This shows how extensive the power of Allah who creates the laws of nature. Even then, only the natural laws that humans already know, not to mention other natural laws that humans still don't know. Especially for humans, intelligent beings, because they consist of body and spirit, their bodies are subject to these natural laws, whether they want it or not. While spiritually required to follow God's guidance conveyed through revelation to His apostles. The scholars of theology say that Allah, the Creator of nature, is a person who is obligated to exist, while creatures are called mumkinat al-wuja (which may exist). Al-Mumkinat is divided into intelligent and non-reasoning. Intellectual beings recognize the oneness of Allah because they can observe the signs of Allah's power in the heavens, on the earth, and in all the things that exist in both. Therefore, the lips of a believer human always glorify Allah. While creatures that have no mind submit to aá¸¥kam kauniyyah (ie the natural laws created by Allah that apply to natural objects). They glorify Allah by behaving according to the circumstances destined for each of them. Allah then explained that the Meccan polytheists did not know that natural objects and all existing creatures glorified Him, because they did not want to acknowledge the oneness of Allah. In fact, they created other gods associated with Allah. The polytheists do not want to see and think about the submission of the universe and all objects and creatures on earth to these natural laws, as a reflection of their tasbih praising Allah SWT. Looking at several surahhs of the Qur'an (al-Baqarah\/2: 29; al-An'am\/6: 125), the sky is divided into seven layers. If we scientifically assume that the word \"sky\" here is the atmosphere, the sky that is closest to the earth, and not the outer sky, then the science that humans have today confirms it. The division into seven layers is based on differences in chemical content and different air temperatures in each layer. The seven layers are called Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, Exosphere, Ionosphere and Magnetosphere. The mention of the seven layers of heaven is also revealed in surahh Nuh\/71: 15 and al-Naba'\/78: 12. Furthermore, in surahh Fushshilat\/41: 11-12 it is stated that each layer of heaven has its own affairs. Science has confirmed this, for example, there is a layer whose job is to make rain, prevent radiation damage, reflect radio waves, up to a layer that prevents meteors from damaging the earth. This verse symbolically shows that the tasbih of objects in nature physically is their (voluntary) obedience to Allah's law that governs them or also known as sunatullah. God's law is known to humans as natural law or scientific rules that are known to humans (experts) and apply to all creatures including humans (physically). What is meant by \"all of you do not understand their tasbih\" is that the majority of people do not understand sunatullah or natural laws which are understood only by experts. So only people who are intelligent and knowledgeable can understand the laws of nature and thus can also understand the tasbih of the objects between the seven heavens and all the earth. At the end of the verse, Allah swt confirms that He is indeed Most Forbearing. Therefore, He did not immediately pass down the punishment on the polytheists of the polytheists of Mecca and for their negligence they did not want to pay attention to the signs of the power of Allah, the Most Forgiving. Among the characteristics of Allah's forgiving nature is that he still opens the door of repentance as wide as possible to anyone who asks for His forgiveness. Allah will not punish them for the sins they have committed, if they repent and regret their actions with true regret, truly stop polytheism, return to the religion of monotheism, and follow the guidance of the revelations revealed to His messengers."

Therefore, they are hindered from understanding the verses of the Qur'an that really call for attention and concentration. This mental damage is due to their habit of following in the footsteps of their ancestors, even though what they are following is not true.

From their words it appears that they do not want to believe in the resurrection day. According to their belief, when humans have died and become scattered bones, moreover they have been shattered, it is impossible for them to reassemble and become living creatures as before. This is the main reason why they reject the truth of Muhammad's revelation and apostleship. Their denial of the Day of Resurrection is caused by their attitude which equates something that is beyond the capacity of their minds with events that are commonly experienced on a daily basis. Whereas the power to resurrect all creatures is in the hands of Allah who originally created them. All that is beyond the capacity of their minds or reason. If they would pay attention to the signs of Allah's power in the heavens, on the earth, and in all the things around them, they would certainly justify the events of the day of resurrection. Allah swt said: (Unbelievers) said, \"Are we really going to be returned to our original life? Will (will also be resurrected) when we have become broken bones?\" They said, \"Then it is a loss return.\" (an-Nazi'at\/79: 10-12) And he made a parable for Us and forgot the origin of what happened; he said, \"Who can give life to the bones, which are shattered?\" Say (Muhammad), \"The one who will bring it to life is (Allah) who created it first.

Allah SWT explains the reason for His prohibition, namely that Satan can spoil the atmosphere and spread disaster between the believers and polytheists when they speak harshly and disagree. Disputes between them can lead to conflict, even fights. In this case, the Prophet Muhammad once forbade a Muslim man to point at him with a piece of iron, for fear that Satan would release the weapon from his hand and then hit the Prophet. This will cause that person to sin and be sent to hell. Narrated by Imam Ahmad from Abu Hurairah, he said that the Messenger of Allah said: Do not one of you point a weapon at his brother, because in fact he does not know, maybe Satan will release the weapon from his hand, so he will enter the valley of hell.

He chooses among His servants who deserves to receive prophetic duties and religious knowledge. He is also the one who prefers one servant over another, according to His knowledge and power alone. This verse is also a refutation of the polytheists who say that it is far from possible for Muhammad, who was only an orphan and was raised by his uncle, Abu Talib, to become a prophet. If his followers were only people who were hungry and dressed in rags, it would be impossible for nobles and Quraysh leaders to want to become his followers. The mention that Allah knows more about His creatures in the heavens and on earth in this verse is a refutation of their assumptions and wishes that Allah should have sent an angel or a great person from Mecca or Taif, to be His messenger. God's Word: Why are not the angels sent down to us. (al-Furqan\/25: 21) God's Word also: And they (also) said, \"Why was this Al-Qur'an not revealed to a big man (rich and influential) from one of these two countries (Mecca and Taif)? \" (az-Zukhruf\/43: 31) Among God's servants chosen to be His messengers are those who have spiritual virtues and a clean soul. Allah swt prefers some prophets over others according to His choice too, such as the Prophet Abraham was given a privilege so that he was given the title Khalilullah and the Prophet Musa was also given a privilege so he was given the title Kalimullah. The Prophet Muhammad was given the highest miracle among all miracles, namely the Qur'an and was given the glory of facing directly into His presence during Isra' and Mi'raj. Allah swt said: We have preferred some of them over others. Among them there are those whom Allah (directly) spoke with and some of them who He exalted by several degrees. And We gave Jesus the son of Maryam some miracles and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. (al-Baqarah\/2: 253) At the end of the verse, Allah mentions that He has given the Psalms to David as. Thus, it can be understood that the priority of the Prophet David, was not only because he became a king, but because he also obtained a book from Allah. The special mention of the Zabur in this verse is because in the book it is stated that the Prophet Muhammad is the Seal of Prophets and his people are good people too. Allah swt said: And indeed, We have written in the Zabur after (written) in Az-Zikr (Lauá¸¥ Maá¸¥fudh), that this earth will be inherited by My pious servants.

The ancients who denied His signs (miracles) as given to His earlier apostles, will be destroyed. Likewise the people of Quraysh who asked the Prophet Muhammad, so that Allah would also send down His signs to them.

Then he described the situation of Baitul Maqdis and told them about the story of isra'. Then Walid bin Mugirah said, \"This person is a magician.\" Then this verse was revealed. Allah swt supported the Prophet in carrying out his apostolic duties and would protect him from the deception of those who denied his treatise by reminding the Apostle and revealing to him that God's knowledge encompasses all matters of human affairs. The meaning is that Allah is Almighty over all His servants. They are under His grip so that they cannot move except according to His provisions. Allah has the power to protect His Messenger from those who are against him, so that they cannot arbitrarily hurt his heart. Allah swt said: And Allah protects you from (trouble) humans. (al-Ma'idah \/ 5: 67) According to al-Hasan's statement, Allah swt will hinder their every attempt to kill the Prophet. Allah swt said: And (remember), when the disbelievers (Quraish) thought of deceit against you (Muhammad) to arrest and imprison you or kill you, or expel you. They devised and Allah thwarted the deception. Allah is the best avenger of deceit. (al-Anfal\/8: 30) Allah also explains the rejection of the people of Quraysh against what was shown to the Prophet Muhammad on the night of Isra' and Mi'raj, like the zaqqum tree that grows in hell. This is a test, which of his followers is truly a believer and who is a denier. Those who truly have faith grow stronger in their faith, but those whose faith is only in words only grow in denial. The zaqqum tree mentioned in the Qur'an is also a test for them, when they hear Muslims reciting the verse: Truly the zaqqum tree is food for people who sin a lot. (ad-Dukhan\/44: 43-44) They dispute it; people whose faith is strong, their faith is getting stronger, but people who deny the apostle of Muhammad saw increase in disbelief. Abu Jahl, for example, is among those who deny it. At that time he said, \"Actually the son of Abu Kabsyah (Muhammad saw) threatens you with the threat of hell, the fuel of which is stone, then he thinks trees grow in hell, even though you know that fire burns trees.\" 'Abdullah bin az-Zibara said, \"Actually Muhammad scared us with the zaqqum tree that was nothing but dates and cheese, so swallow it.\" They then ate the dates and cheese. The Quraysh polytheists did not believe that in hell there is a plant called the zaqqum tree, because they think that fire destroys everything. They do not know that in this world there are also astonishing miracles, even more so in the hereafter. For example, in the world there is a kind of fiber that is not burnt by fire (asbestos). This material is often used for fire-resistant clothing materials. This earth contains fire (ie magma) in the bowels of the earth which will be seen when a volcano erupts, but green trees grow on it. Even wood or stone can emit fire when rubbed. Even in water there is an element of oxygen that causes the fire to burn. In short, the hearts of the Quraysh disbelievers did not want to accept the truth of the Qur'an. Their denial of ar-ru'ya (a dream or what the Prophet saw during his Isra') and the zaqqum tree is clear evidence of their denial. Allah swt said: Indeed, We have made it (the zaqqum tree) as punishment for the wrongdoers. Truly, it is a tree that comes out of the bottom of the hell of Jahim, its trunk like the heads of demons.

Such an attitude was caused by his arrogance, as reflected in his words, \"Shall I prostrate to Adam who was created from dust, while I was created from fire.\" In the opinion of Satan, fire is more noble than earth. Such words of the Devil are expressed in another verse, as mentioned in the word of Allah: (Satan) said, \"I am better than him, because You created me from fire, while You created him from clay.\" (shad\/38: 76) Iblis became a disbeliever because he disobeyed Allah's commands and was arrogant. He thought that Allah swt had ordered something that was out of place. Such an assumption by Satan is only his own imagination. The assumption that fire is more noble than earth is an assumption that is not true, because fire and land are both God's creatures. Allah who created it from nothing, then exaggerates its usefulness from one over the other, according to His wisdom. Fire can burn, while land can grow. Both are supporting human life.

Allah swt said: Allah said, \"(All right) then indeed you are among those who are given suspension, until the appointed day (Doomsday).\" (al-hijr\/15: 37-38)"

			"tafsir": "This verse explains further, to what extent is Satan's ability to tempt Adam's descendants on this earth. Allah swt allows Satan to incite anyone among the descendants of Adam, according to his ability and ability with his persuasion and deceit. Satan's trick to tempt Adam's descendants is described as if a commander in chief was deploying an army on horseback and reinforced by soldiers on foot. They attack their enemies with the accompaniment of loud noises in order to surprise their enemies to immediately submit and submit under their rule. In relation to the tafsir of this verse, Imam Mujahid explained that every mounted army that is used to attack the enemy by violating Allah's laws, is an army that is tempted by Satan. And the army on foot that fights in violation of God's provisions, including the army of Satan. Another commentator explains that Satan no longer has an army on horseback and an army on foot. The purpose of this parable is to describe the followers of Satan and his supporters, regardless of their circumstances, whether those who act as supporters or followers are soldiers on horseback or soldiers on foot. As a clear illustration, Allah likens the Devil and his followers in tempting the descendants of Adam as people who gather together to collect wealth and children, which encourages them to fall into disobedience and follow lust. In short, it can be said that Satan is trying his best to tempt Adam's descendants, so that they fall into God's prohibition. The devil tempts their hearts to be interested in a religion that God does not approve of, tempts them to commit adultery, or likes to kill and bury their children alive. God also allowed Satan to make promises to Adam's descendants with promises that could deceive them so that they were complacent from His commands and violated His prohibitions. However, Satan's promises are only a deception, no temptation can prevent God's punishment that will be inflicted on them. Satan's promises are just a dazzling deception so that they are no longer able to distinguish between what is true and what is false. Allah swt said: And Satan said when the matter (recount) had been settled, \"Verily Allah has promised you a true promise, and I also promised you but I violated it. There is no power for me over you, except (only) I call you then you obey my call, therefore do not revile me, but blame yourselves (Ibrahim\/14: 22)"

Satan has no power to compel them to submit to his deceptions. The Devil's ability is just a tease. People who can be influenced are those who do not have strong faith. Therefore, Allah swt confirms at the end of this verse that for those who have strong faith it is enough to surrender to Allah, and ask Him for protection so that they are free from the temptations and tricks of Satan. In this verse, there is a sign indicating that humans basically do not have immunity against Satan's temptations and do not have personal control that saves them from going astray. Immunity and personal control is only protection and the abundance of Allah's grace."

Carrying out the five daily prayers is doing and fulfilling them complete with the pillars and conditions, continuously being done, in accordance with Allah's commands, both physically and mentally. What is meant outwardly is praying in accordance with the provisions set by religion. Meanwhile, inwardly, it is praying with full devotion, because you feel the majesty and power of Allah who controls and creates all of this world. Rasulullah SAW ordered the Muslims to worship Allah in a state as if they saw Allah SWT. That is ihsan as the Prophet said: Ihsan is that you worship Allah, as if you see Him. If you cannot see Him, then surely He sees you. (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) If a servant of Allah prays five times a day, it means he has done one of the pillars of Islam, according to the hadith of the Prophet: Islam is founded on five: the creed that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, establish prayers, pay zakat, fast Ramadan, and make pilgrimage to Baitullah for those who can afford to travel. (Muslim history from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar ra) In this verse it is explained that the morning prayer was witnessed by angels. The point is that at dawn the night guard angel meets the day guard angel to change duties, and both of them report to Allah that the person concerned is praying when they leave, as explained in the hadith of the Prophet saw: From Abu Hurairah, that the Prophet saw said, \"The night and day angels alternate in their duties. They gather at the time of Fajr and Asr prayers. Then the angels who guard you at night go up, and God asks them (though Allah knows better about you), \"How is my servant when you left?\" The angels replied, \"We came to them, they were in a state of prayer and we left them, they were also in a state of prayer too.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim) ar-Razi said, \"Verily, at dawn, humans witness the signs of Allah's power and the greatness of His wisdom in heaven and on earth.

This verse is the verse that first ordered the Prophet to perform night prayers in addition to the obligatory prayers. Tonight's prayer is explained by the hadith of the Prophet saw: That the Prophet saw was asked, \"Which prayer is the most important after the obligatory prayers (praying five times a day).\" Rasulullah saw replied, \"Tahajud prayer.\" (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) From the authentic hadiths of the Prophet, which were narrated from 'A'isyah and Ibn 'Abbas it is understood that the Prophet Muhammad woke up to perform the midnight prayer, after he had slept. This custom of the Prophet can be used as a legal basis that the midnight prayer is a circumcision performed by a person, after sleeping for a while at night, then in the middle of the night he gets up to pray the midnight prayer. Then Allah swt explained that the law of the midnight prayer was as an additional worship for the Prophet besides praying five times a day. Therefore, the law for the Messenger of Allah is obligatory, while for his people it is circumcision. In this verse, it is explained that the purpose of the midnight prayer for Prophet Muhammad is so that Allah SWT can place him in a maqaman mahmudan (in a commendable place). What is meant by maqaman mahmudan is the intercession of Rasulullah SAW on the Day of Resurrection. On that day humans will experience a very difficult situation that is beyond compare. The only thing that can relieve and relieve people from this very difficult situation is only the Prophet Muhammad's request to his God, so that people can be relieved and relieved of their suffering. It was narrated by at-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah said, \"The meaning of maqaman mahmudan in this verse is my intercession.\" (Hadith hasan sahih) Ibn Jarir ath-tabari said that most experts said, \"What is meant by maqaman mahmudan is a position that is used by the Messenger of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to intercede for people, so that Allah will ease the troubles and difficulties they experience. experienced that day.\" Narrated by an-Nasa'i, al-hakim, and a group of hadith experts from Hudzaifah, \"Allah gathered people in a large area on the Day of Judgment, they all stood up and no one spoke on that day except with His permission. The person whose name was first called was Muhammad, so Muhammad prayed to Him. This is what is meant by maqaman mahmudan in this verse. Al-Bukhari narrated from Jabir bin 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah said: Whoever reads the prayer after finished hearing the call to prayer, \"O my Lord, God Who has this perfect call and prayer that is done, give Muhammad wasilah and primacy and raise him to al-maqam al-mahmud (commendable position) that You have promised him,\" then he obtain my intercession. It is narrated from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah said, \"I am the leader of Adam's children and grandchildren on the Day of Judgment. I am not proud of myself, and in my hand I hold the liwa'ul hamdi (flag of praise) I am not proud of myself. There was not a single prophet on that day, from Adam to the other prophets, except under my flag, I was the first to come out of the earth, and I did not boast. Humans at that time were frightened by three frightening things. Then they came to Adam. They said, \"You are our father, help us to your Lord.\" Adam replied, \"I have a sin that caused me to be brought down to earth. Come to Noah!\" so they came to Noah. (After they complained about their problems to Noah), Noah said, \"I have prayed for the inhabitants of the earth so that they are destroyed. But come to Abraham. Come to Isa.\" Jesus then said, \"I was once worshiped besides Allah. Just come to Muhammad.\" So they came to me. I then went with them, then I held the circle door of heaven, then I pulled. Then I was asked, \"Who is that?\" I replied, \"Muhammad.\" Then they opened the door for me, and said, \"Welcome.\" then I fell prostrate. Then Allah inspired me to praise, worship, and glorify Him. Then I was ordered, \"Raise your head, ask! you will be given. Ask for intercession, and you will be permitted to intercede. And speak, your words will be heard. That is the commendable station, which Allah said, \"May your Lord give you a commendable station.\" (History of at-Tirmidhi) From the verses and hadiths above it is understood that the Prophet Muhammad saw by performing the midnight prayer would be appointed by Allah swt to a place and position that was praised by mankind, the angels, and Allah Tabaraka wa Taala, namely the position for ask for intercession for mankind while in Padang Mahsyar with Allah's permission. Humans are indeed entitled to intercession because of their good deeds and good manners while in the world, that is, their sins are forgiven by God or they are elevated in rank. In another word of God, it is explained that getting up in the middle of the night to pray the midnight prayer and reciting the Qur'an fervently can make your faith strong and develop yourself. Allah swt said: O you who are covered (Muhammad)! Get up (to pray) at night, except for a small part. (That is) half or a little less than that, or more than (half) that, and recite the Qur'an slowly. Indeed, We will send down heavy words on you.

Which was brought down by ar-Ruh al-Amin (Gabriel), into your heart (Muhammad) so that you will be among those who give warnings. (asy-Syu'ara'\/26: 193-194) And the word of Allah swt: ¦then We sent Our spirit (Gabriel) to him, so he appeared before him in perfect human form. (Maryam\/19: 17) Third: Means the spirit that is in the body, which is the source of life for living things. According to Jumhur Ulama, the word spirit in this verse is the spirit that is in the body (soul). Allah's Word: And (remember the story of Maryam) who kept her honor, then We blew (spirit) from Us into her (body); We made him and his son a sign (of Allah's greatness) for the whole world. (al-Anbiya'\/21: 91) This opinion which equates the spirit with the nafs (spirit\/soul) is the opinion held by many scholars (jumhur) and is in accordance with why this verse was revealed. Allah said: So when I have perfected (the incident) it, and I have breathed My spirit (creation) into it, then submit to it by prostrating. (al-hijr\/15: 29) The above verses invite mankind to understand the true contents of the Qur'an, so as not to stray onto the wrong path. On the other hand, those who do not try to understand the contents of the Qur'an will not be able to use it as a guide for life, and they will even take actions and actions that can keep them from understanding its verses properly. They asked the Prophet about things that could not possibly be known by humans, which actually had no point in knowing, except to test the Prophet. Allah swt in this verse states that He only gives humans very little knowledge about spirits. However, among the scholars there are those who have tried to explore the nature of the spirit. Among them are: 1. The spirit is a kind of light matter (body, conscience) that descends into the world from the high realms, its nature is different from matter that can be seen and touched. 2. The spirit flows in the human body, as water flows in flowers, or as fire flows in coals. The spirit gives life to a person's body as long as the body is able and able to receive it, and nothing blocks its flow. If the body is unable and able to accept the spirit any longer, so that its flow is blocked in the body, then the body dies. This opinion was expressed by ar-Razi and Ibnul Qayyim. Meanwhile, Imam al-Gazali and Abu Qasim ar-Ragib al-Asfahani argue that the spirit is not material and something in form, but it is only something that depends on the body to take care of and complete the body's interests. The best attitude of Muslims regarding the spirit is to follow this word of Allah, that the nature of the spirit cannot be reached by the human mind, because only Allah knows for sure. What needs to be believed is that the spirit exists. God only gives the symptoms to humans themselves, even knowing that the spirit exists, and experiencing its symptoms. So what needs to be researched and studied seriously are the symptoms of the spirit, which are carried out in psychology. Studying the symptoms of this soul even includes things that are asked by God in His word: And (also) yourself. So don't you pay attention? adz-dzariyat\/51: 21) Since only Allah knows about the nature of the spirit, then in this verse Allah confirms to humans that Allah's knowledge is vast, unpredictable, covering all kinds of knowledge, both knowledge about the real nature, as well as that which is not real, whether it is attainable by the five senses or not. Because of God's love for humans, He bestowed a small portion of that knowledge on humans, it means nothing when compared to the level of God's knowledge. It is narrated that when this verse was revealed, the Jews replied, \"We have been given a lot of knowledge. We have been given the Torah. Whoever has been given the Torah means he has been given a lot of goodness.\" Then came verse 109 of surahh al-Kahf. Allah swt said: Say (Muhammad), \"If the ocean were ink for (writing) the sentences of my Lord, then the ocean would surely have been used up before the completion (writing) of the sentences of my Lord, even though We brought an additional amount of it (too).\" (al-Kahf\/18: 109)"

The ease with which Allah swt erased the Qur'an was explained in the hadith of the Prophet saw: It was narrated from Ibn Mas'ud that the Messenger of Allah said, \"Surely this Al-Qur'an will be removed (deleted).\" Someone said, \"How is it possible, indeed Allah has strengthened it in our hearts, and we have enshrined (written) it in written sheets.\" He said, \"Lift up the Qur'an in one night, not a single verse from it is left in the heart nor in the Mushaf, unless all are lifted up. So in the morning not a single verse will remain on you.\" Then the Prophet read this verse. (History of Sa'id bin Mansur and al-hakim and declared valid by ath-thabrani and al-Baihaqi). After the Al-Qur'an is erased from the heart and what is written in the mushaf, then at that time there is nothing else to hold on to and guide to the right path. No one is able to return it, either in the form of mushaf or rote."

The Qur'an is the greatest blessing that Allah has given to mankind. He keeps the Qur'an in people's hearts and protects it from their interference. According to ar-Razi, there are two kinds of great blessings that Allah has given to scholars: first, it makes it easier for them to acquire knowledge, and secondly, the knowledge remains in their minds and memories. With these two kinds of favors, it is easy for humans to digest the contents of the verses of the Qur'an and then carry out what He commands and stop what He prohibits. Thus, they are protected from destruction in this world and the punishment of hell in the hereafter. In this verse Allah explains that the priority He gave to the Prophet Muhammad was so great that Allah did not want the revelations that had been revealed to him to be erased. This revelation is God's greatest blessing to the Prophet and believers because it contains guidance and healing from various diseases."

Therefore, send down to us a book that we can examine. If you are unable to bring it, then we will bring you something similar to what you brought. So Allah swt sent down this verse which confirmed to them that all of them would not be able to make a book like the Qur'an. Sabab nuzul this verse was not agreed upon by the scholars because this surah was a Makkiyah surahh and the target was the Quraysh, while the Jews lived in Medina.In this verse, Allah swt confirms the miracle of the Qur'an and its virtue, namely that the Qur'an is truly from Allah and was sent down to to the Prophet Muhammad saw. As proof that the Qur'an is from Allah, not Muhammad's creation as alleged by the Meccan infidels and people of the book, Allah swt ordered the Prophet Muhammad to deliver a challenge to those who ignore and look at the Qur'an it is not a revelation of Allah to make a counterpoint to the Qur'an. But Allah made it clear that they would not be able to produce the same book. Allah said: And if you doubt (the Qur'an) that We sent down to Our servant (Muhammad), then compose a surah like it and invite your helpers besides Allah, if you are truthful. If you are not able to make it, and (certainly) will not be able to, then fear the fire of hell whose fuel is human and stone, which is prepared for the disbelievers. (al-Baqarah\/2: 23-24) History shows that many leaders and experts in Arabic literature tried to emulate and imitate the Qur'an, some even claimed to be a prophet, such as Musailamah al-Kadzdzab, thulaiá¸¥ah , Habalah bin Kaab, and others. However, they all failed in their efforts and even received ridicule and contempt from society. An example is what Musailamah al-Kadzdzab has made which he thinks can match the verses of the Qur'an: O frog, child of two frogs, scream what you want to scream. Your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the ground. The experts stated that Musailamah's words did not contain any meaning. Among those who commented was al-Jahiz, a well-known Arab writer who said, \"I don't understand what moved Musailamah's soul to mention frogs and so on, how bad is the composition he says is a verse of the Qur'an that has been revealed to Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The possibility of the cooperation of jinns and humans mentioned here is to compensate for the Angel Gabriel and the Prophet Muhammad who received the Qur'an from Allah."

He bases his opinion on the hadith of the Prophet narrated by Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, al-Baihaqi, Ath-thabrani, an-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah from shafwan bin Origin al-Muradi, when he was asked by the Jews, that what is meant by the nine verses here are nine kinds of prohibitions, namely: do not associate partners with Allah, do not kill a soul except by right, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bewitch, do not eat usury, do not slander innocent people against the authorities, do not accuse a good woman commits adultery, and breaks the law on the Sabbath. Ibn Syihab Al-Khafaji said, \"This is the tafsir followed in interpreting this verse.\" Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to ask about the story of Moses to the Jews who lived in his time, such as Abdullah bin Salam and others, they would undoubtedly confirm it. Their acknowledgment of the truth of the message of Prophet Musa will increase their faith and confidence. It was also intended that the Prophet saw be sure that the story is also contained in their book. Ask the Jews, of course they will explain that Musa (as) had come to Pharaoh with the monotheistic religion and presented his various miracles. However, Pharaoh denied this, even saying that Musa was a person whose mind was corrupted, so he claimed to be an apostle of Allah."

In another verse, Allah swt says: But Allah bears witness to (the Qur'an) which He has sent down to you (Muhammad). He sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels watched. And Allah is sufficient as a witness. (an-Nisa'\/4: 166) The Qur'an contains various true teachings that bring order and prosperity to mankind. In it there are teachings about morals, divine creed, regulations, laws, history, and science. Everything in it is always maintained, both the pronunciation and the meaning will not be tarnished by additions or subtractions that cause chaos and confusion, as explained by Allah in His word: Verily, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and surely We (also) who maintain it. (al-hijr\/15: 9) His words again: (Which) will not be visited by evil either from before or from behind (in the past and in the future), which was sent down from God, the Most Wise, Most Praised. (Fushshilat\/41: 42) Thus Allah explains the characteristics of the Qur'an with all guarantees of its purity from human hands who try to pollute it. He was sent down to the Prophet Muhammad who was sent to mankind to give good news about rewards and heaven for those who believe and obey religious teachings, and give warnings about doom and hell for those who disbelieve and commit sins."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah SWT explains that the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad SAW gradually, part by part, so that he could read it to his people, and give understanding slowly. The verses of the Qur'an were first revealed in the month of Ramadan, on the night of qadar, then they were revealed to the Prophet gradually according to the needs and events that occurred in less than twenty-three years. With this gradual decline, Muslims gain great advantages and benefits, including: First: The Muslims can easily memorize it when it is revealed. Second: Muslims have the opportunity to understand each group of verses that were revealed, because the wide range of meanings requires sufficient time to understand them in order to get a proper and correct understanding. Third: Muslims do not experience significant emotional turmoil in facing the various changes brought about by Islam. Before the advent of Islam, they adhered to various animist beliefs, and had no rules and regulations to live by. The gradual reduction of the Qur'an made it easier for them to adapt to the new teachings, both teachings related to faith, as well as those related to worship and society. Fourth: Some of the verses of the Al-Qur'an are explanations related to an event that occurred. Word of Allah swt: And they (the disbelievers) do not come to you (bring) anything strange, but We bring to you the truth and the best explanation. (al-Furqan\/25: 33) Thus, Muslims feel that they are always guided and guided by Allah SWT when facing any events that occur between them. For the Prophet Muhammad, the gradual reduction of the Qur'an was very beneficial in strengthening his heart, as Allah explained in His word: And the disbelievers said, \"Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once ?\" Thus, so that We strengthen your heart (Mu-hammad) with it and We recite it tartil (gradually, slowly and correctly). (al-Furqan\/25: 32) In general, the verses revealed ranged from five to ten verses as needed, as Umar bin Khaththab said: Narrated from Umar ra, he said, \"Learn the five verses of the Qur'an five verses, because actually Gabriel sent it down five verses five verses (Al-Baihaqi History)."

Vice versa, if they still deny, do not want to believe in the Qur'an, their denial and rejection will not reduce the majesty of Allah SWT. Allah's Word: And they said, \"We will not believe in you (Muhammad) until you bring forth springs of water from the earth for us. (al-Isra'\/17: 90) This statement of the Messenger of Allah is a reproach and condemnation of the polytheists, and contains insults to them. However their attitude towards the Qur'an, should not be cared for. The truth of the Qur'an does not depend on the attitude of those who deny it. It is not surprising that they reject the truth of the Qur'an, because they are ignorant people. But the good and educated people among them certainly believe and submit completely when they hear the verses of the Qur'an being recited. Like Zaid bin Amru bin Nufail and Waraqah bin Naufal who had read the previous holy books before The Qur'an was revealed, and they know that one day an apostle of the end times will be born. They bow down and give thanks to Allah SWT who has fulfilled His promise, namely to send Muhammad SAW as the Messenger of Allah. end. With the revelation of this verse, the Prophet Muhammad saw comforted his heart, because the faith of educated people is more meaningful than the faith of ignorant people, even though the faith of ignorant people is still expected."

The influence of the teachings of the Qur'an seeped into their souls when they heard the verses being recited, and increased their solemnity and humility. Thus, they feel how small humans are in the sight of Allah swt. Such is the nature of a knowledgeable person who has attained a noble dignity. His heart was subdued and his eyes filled with tears when the Qur'an was recited to him. Shedding tears when hearing or reading the Qur'an is highly commendable in the eyes of Islam. Rasulullah SAW said: Read the Qur'an and cry, if you can't cry, then try your best to cry. hell, that is, those who cry out of fear of Allah swt, and eyes that keep watch at night in the way of Allah (jihad).

			"tafsir": "Sabab nuzul this verse, according to the history of Ibn Jarir ath-tabari from Ibn 'Abbas, that the Messenger of Allah was praying one day in Mecca, then he prayed. In his prayer, he uttered the words, \"O Allah, O Rahman.\" The polytheists who heard the Prophet's words said, \"Pay attention to this person who has left his religion, it is forbidden for us to pray to two Gods while he himself prays to two Gods. So this verse was revealed. According to the history of Adh-ahhak, because this verse was revealed is that the Jews asked the Prophet why he mentioned the word ar-Rahman so little, whereas in the Torah, Allah mentions it so much.\" Then come down this verse. If the background of this verse is revealed according to the first history, Allah will explain to the polytheists that the two pronunciations (Allah and ar-Rahman) although different, express the One and Only God, the only God to be worshiped. Such an understanding is in accordance with the explanation of verse 111. If the background of the revelation of this verse is the second history, then Allah explained to the Jews that the pronunciation is equally good for expressing what is meant. The Jews view the word ar-Rahman as better, because it is the attribute that Allah likes the most, so it is mentioned in the Torah a lot. Ar-Rahman is mentioned a lot in the Torah because Prophet Musa (as) was tough and angry. Therefore, Allah mentions ar-Rahman's words so that he gets along with his people with compassion, and he as a prophet certainly imitates Allah's qualities. In this verse, Allah swt explains about the oneness of His substance with good names. These good names only describe the attributes of His perfection, not the form of Allah who stands alone as the polytheists think. After stating the similarity of the two words, Allah confirms in this verse that the two pronunciations are good for prayer, because God has al-asma'ul husna (the best names). God provides explanations with al-husna (the best) for His names, because they contain meanings that include all the attributes of perfection, glory, and beauty that no creature resembles. The Jews actually did not deny the good names of God. It's just that they see ar-Rahman the best name among the other names of God. This is what is not justified in this verse because the two names include al-asma'ul husna. Opinions like the above are also shared by Muslims, where according to them, there is a higher name among al-asma'ul husna. It was narrated that the Messenger of Allah heard a man reciting a prayer: O Allah, I beg You, so that I truly testify that You are Allah, who has no god but You, the One and the place where all creatures depend. Who is childless and unborn and no one is equal to Him. (History of at-Tirmidhi from Abdullah bin Buraidah al-Aslami from his father) After hearing this prayer the Prophet said: By Allah, in whose hands is my soul, truly that man prays in the name of the Great God (al-asma' al-A'dham), which if Allah is called on by (mentioning) that name, surely He will complete it, and if Allah is asked by (mentioning) that name, He will surely give it. (History of Ibn Jarir ath-tabari from Sa'ad) It was also narrated by Muslim, Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Abi Hatim from Asma' bint Yazid that the Prophet said: The Name of Allah Ta'ala, the Most Great is located in these two verses , namely: And your God is God Almighty, there is no god but Him, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. (al-Baqarah\/2: 163) And the second verse is at the opening of surahh ali 'Imran: Alif Lam Mim. Allah, there is no god but Him. The Ever-living One, Who is constantly taking care of (His creatures). (ali 'Imran\/3: 1-2) Then at the end of this verse, Allah ordered the Messenger not to read the verses loudly and not in a low voice during prayers, but between the two. What is meant by reading this verse includes reading the basmalah and other verses. If the Apostle read it aloud, the polytheists would have heard it and they would mock, criticize, and insult the Qur'an, the Prophet and his companions. But don't also read in a voice that is too low so that friends cannot hear it clearly. This prohibition came down when the Prophet was still in Mecca based on the history of Ibn 'Abbas. According to the history of Ibn 'Abbas, when the Apostle was in Mecca he was told to read verses in a voice that was not too loud but not too low, it was forbidden to read in a low and low voice so that it would not be heard. But after migrating to Medina, this issue was not discussed any more except that reciting verses in prayer out loud is still not justified."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, the Prophet was taught how to praise Allah, who has the qualities of oneness, perfection, and majesty. Therefore, only Allah has the right to receive all kinds of praise and gratitude from His servants and creatures for all the blessings given to them. This verse describes three characteristics for Allah swt: First: That Allah does not have children, because whoever has children certainly does not enjoy all the blessings he has, but some of these blessings are prepared for the children he leaves behind when he dies. Glory be to Allah swt from such traits. People who have children are prevented from enjoying all their rights in all circumstances. Therefore, humans do not deserve praise from all creatures. With this verse, Allah swt explains and refute the view of the Jews who say 'Uzair is the son of God, also the opinion of the Christians who say that Al-Masih is the son of God, or the opinion of the polytheists that angels are the daughters of God. Second: That Allah swt has no partner in His kingdom. If His partners were present, it would be difficult to determine which of the two deserved the praise, gratitude and devotion of beings. One of the two gods certainly needs help from the other and in the end there is no single god that stands alone and is absolutely sovereign over this world. Third: That in fact none of the despicable people is given power by Allah that will protect him from enemies who threaten him. Thus Allah swt is holy from all qualities that reduce His perfection, so that His servants do not hesitate to offer prayers, thanks and praise to Him. Then the Holy Prophet was ordered to glorify Him, both in word and deed. To glorify and sanctify Allah is as follows: First: To glorify Allah in His Essence by believing that Allah must exist in Him because His own substance does not need anything else. He doesn't need anything from this form. Second: Glorify Allah swt in His nature, believing that only He has all the characteristics of perfection and is far from the characteristics of deficiencies. Third: Glorifying Allah swt in His deeds (His actions) by believing that nothing happens in this world, but according to His wisdom and will. Fourth: Glorify Allah SWT in His laws, believing that only He is the Ruler who is obeyed in this universe, where orders and prohibitions originate from him. No one can limit and cancel all of His provisions for something. It is He who glorifies and He also humiliates those He wills. Fifth: Glorify His names, namely calling on and calling Allah with good names (al-asma'ul husna). Not characterizing God but with the attributes of holiness and perfection."
