			"tafsir": "Alif Lam Mim. The first verse of surah Al-Baqarah consists of loose letters. As in many Makkiyah surahs that are opened with loose letters such as Alif Lam Ra, Alif Lam Mim Ra, ha Mim, ta Ha, Kaf Ha Ya 'Ain sad, and others. The suras beginning with abbreviated letters (muqattha'ah) total 29 suras. Details as follows: al-Baqarah with Alif Lam Mim, Ali 'Imran begins with Alif Lam Mim, al-A'raf begins with Alif Lam Mim sad, Yunus with Alif Lam Ra, Hud with Alif Lam Ra, ar-Ra'd with Alif Lam Mim Ra; Ibrahim with Alif Lam Ra; al-hijr with Alif Lam Ra; Maryam with Kaf Ha Ya 'Ain sad; taha with ta ha; asy-Syu'ara' with ta Sin Mim; an-Naml with ta Sin; al-Qasas with ta Sin Mim; al-'Ankabut with Alif Lam Mim; ar-Rum with Alif Lam Mim, Luqman with Alif Lam Mim, as-Sajdah with Alif Lam Mim, Yasin with Ya Sin; sad with sad; al-Mu'min with ha Mim; Fussilat with ha Mim; ash-Shura with ha Mim; az-Zukhruf with ha Mim; ad-Dukhan with ha Mim; al-Jasiyah with ha Mim; al-Ahqaf with ha Mim; Qaf with Qaf; and al-Qalam with Nun. The letters mentioned are 14 letters, which is half of the hijaiyah letters. These letters are the ones most used in Arabic. These letters are mentioned over and over again. There are two things that need to be said about the letters of the alphabet that are mentioned at the beginning of several surahs of the Qur'an, namely what is meant by these letters, and what is the meaning of mentioning these letters. Regarding the first question, the commentators differed: 1. Some left it up to Allah, meaning they did not want to interpret the letters. They said, \"God alone knows what it means.\" They classify the letters into groups of mutasyabihat verses. 2. There are those who interpret it. The commentators who interpret this also have different opinions: a. There are those who argue that the letters are signs (abbreviations of words), for example Alif Lam Mim. So Alif stands for \"Allah\", Lam stands for \"Gabriel\", and Mim stands for Muhammad, which means that the Qur'an came from Allah, delivered by Gabriel to Muhammad. In Alif Lam Ra, Alif stands for \"Ana\", Lam stands for \"Allah\" and Ra stands for \"ar-Rahman\", which means \"I am Allah, the Most Merciful.\" b. There are those who argue that the letters are the names of the suras that start with those letters. c. Some argue that what is meant by the letters of the alphabet are the letters of the alphabet itself. Then what is meant by Alif is \"Alif\", what is meant by Lam, is \"Lam\", what is meant by Nun is \"Nun\", and so on. d. The letters of the alphabet are to attract attention. There are commentators who argue that these letters of the alphabet were brought by Allah at the beginning of several surahs of the Qur'an to attract attention. Starting a conversation with the letters of the alphabet was a way that was not yet known by the Arabs at that time, because of that this attracted their attention. e. For a challenge. According to these commentators, the abbreviated letters are called Allah at the beginning of several surahs of the Qur'an, the meaning being to \"challenge\". The challenge sounds something like this: The Qur'an was revealed in Arabic, which is your own language, which is composed of abbreviated letters, such as Alif, Lam Mim Ra, Kaf Ha Ya 'Ain sad, Qaf, ta Sin and others. So if you don't believe that the Qur'an came from Allah and you claim it came from Muhammad, that is, it was composed by Muhammad himself, then try to make verses that are like these verses of the Koran. If Muhammad can make it, of course you can make it too.\" So there is a \"challenger\", namely Allah, and there are \"challenged\", namely the Arabs, and there is a \"challenger\", namely the Koran. Even though they are people who are fluent in Arabic, and also know the ins and outs of Arabic according to their instincts, because among them there are poets, poets and orators, however they cannot answer the challenge of the Qur'an by making verses -verses like the Qur'an. There are also those who dared to answer the challenge of the Qur'an, by trying to make sentences like the verses of the Qur'an, but before they were laughed at by people -the Arabs, they had laughed at themselves beforehand."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that the Qur'an cannot be doubted, because it is the revelation of Allah swt which was revealed to the last Prophet Muhammad saw the Prophet through the intercession of Jibril as: And indeed (this Qur'an) was truly sent down by the Lord of all the worlds , which was brought by ar-Ruh al-Amin (Gabriel) (asy-Syu'ara'\/26: 192-193). What is meant by “Al-Kitab” (revelation) here is the Al-Qur'an. Called \"Al-Kitab\" as a sign that the Koran should be written, because the Prophet Muhammad ordered his companions to write verses from the Koran. The Al-Qur'an is a guide for those who are pious, so that they will be happy in this world and in the hereafter. A pious person is a person who protects and protects himself from Allah's punishment by always carrying out Allah's commands and staying away from His prohibitions. Among the signs of a pious person are as mentioned in the following verses:"

			"id": 10,
			"surah": 2,
			"ayat": 3,
			"tafsir": "First: Believe in the unseen. This includes truly believing in Allah, submitting oneself and submitting it according to what is required by that faith. The sign of a person's faith is carrying out everything that is commanded by his faith. Unseen is something that cannot be reached by the five senses. Knowledge of the unseen is solely based on the instructions of Allah SWT. Because we have faith in Allah, we also have faith in His words and instructions. Including the unseen are: Allah, the angels, the Day of Judgment, heaven, hell, mahsyar and so on. The root of faith in the unseen is faith in Allah SWT. Faith in God is the basis for forming the character and characteristics of a human being so that he becomes a real human being, according to God's intention to create humans. \"good God.\" Who is better in sibghah than Allah? And to Him we worship. (al-Baqarah\/2: 138) Faith forms humans into individual creatures and creatures that are members of society, like to give, help, sacrifice, strive and so on: Indeed, the true believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger , then they did not hesitate, and they fought jihad with their wealth and their souls in the way of Allah. They are the right people. (al-hujurat\/49: 15) In seeking the meaning of faith we should follow the instructions of the Apostle. For this reason, we need to study the life history of the Prophet Muhammad, reflect on God's creation, use reason and learn the teachings brought by the Prophet Muhammad. Faith can increase and it can also decrease. Faith will be damaged if one's charity is damaged and will increase if the value and amount of charity is also increased. Second: Carrying out the prayer, namely performing and performing the prayer by perfecting its pillars and conditions, continuing to do it every day according to what Allah has commanded, both physically and spiritually. What is meant by \"outward\" is praying in accordance with the provisions determined by the Sunnah of the Prophet, and what is meant by \"inner\" is praying with a solemn heart, with all submission and obedience to Allah, and feeling the majesty and power of Allah who control and create this whole nature as desired by religion. Iqamah as-salah is doing the prayer perfectly; perfect all pillars, other terms and conditions determined by religion. The original meaning of the word prayer is \"prayer\", then it is used as a term of worship which is known in Islam because prayer contains many prayers. Third: Spend some of the sustenance that has been bestowed by Allah. Fortune is anything that can be taken advantage of. \"spending some of the sustenance\" is giving some of the sustenance or property that has been bestowed by Allah to people who have been determined by religion. The definition of spending wealth in the way of Allah includes spending for the sake of jihad, building colleges, hospitals, scientific research efforts and others. Also donate for all public interests with the intention of carrying out Allah's commands including fi sabilillah. The assets that will be donated are part of it, not all of the assets. In this verse it is not explained how much is meant by a portion, whether it is a half, a third, a quarter and so on. At the same time, Allah forbids being stingy and forbids being extravagant: And don't make your hands shackled around your neck and don't (also) stretch them out too much (very generously), later you will be reprehensible and regretful. (al-Isra'\/17: 29) Allah forbids being extravagant or miserly in spending wealth: And (including the servants of the Most Merciful God) those who spend (wealth), they are not excessive, and are not (also) stingy , but between the two naturally (al-Furqan\/25: 67) In another word of Allah it is explained that what is meant by some of the assets is as the answer to the question of the friends: \".... they ask you (about) what what they (must) spend. Say, 'Excess (of what is needed).\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 219) What is meant by \"excess\" is after they have had enough to eat and have the clothes to wear. So it doesn't have to be rich, but apart from what they eat and wear that day, it includes more. God has explained how to spend the treasure and how to use it. The hadith of Rasulullah SAW explained again: From the Prophet SAW he said, \"The best charity is the excess of basic needs.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim)"

Although believing in books other than the Al-Qur'an is ijmali (global), while believing in the Al-Qur'an must be tafsili (detailed). Believing in these books and sahifahs means also believing in the apostles who were sent by Allah to the ancient peoples without distinguishing one person from another of Allah's messengers. Believing in Allah's books is one of the characteristics of pious people. Those who believe in Allah's books and study their contents are the heirs of the prophets, heirs of Allah's teachings, both the ancients and present people until the end of time. This characteristic will create a feeling in a Muslim that they are one people, their religion is one, Islam. The God they worship is Allah Almighty, Compassionate and Merciful to His servants. This characteristic will eliminate the exclusivism (different nature) in a Muslim, which includes all the arrogant, snobbish, class fanaticism, regionalism and excessive feelings of nationality."

People who have the five characteristics above are people who have received guidance and guidance from Allah and they are the ones who will feel the results of their faith and deeds in the hereafter, they will earn Allah's pleasure and their place of residence in the hereafter will be in heaven. which is full of pleasure.

Kafirs, plural kuffar, are people who do not believe in Allah, His messengers, His angels, His books and the Last Day. In the Qur'an it is stated that the disbelievers, namely the People of the Book and polytheists, were very disbelievers of the Messenger of Allah; they will not believe even if given a warning accompanied by threats. For them it was the same whether they were given a stern warning or not."

			"ayat": 7,
			"tafsir": "The thing that causes disbelievers to not receive warnings is because their hearts and ears are closed, even locked in death, unable to receive instructions, and all kinds of advice do not leave any trace on them. Because their eyesight is closed, they cannot see, pay attention and understand the verses of the Qur'an that they have heard, cannot take lessons from the signs of Allah that they see in the firmament, on the surface of the earth and in themselves. . The hearts and ears are locked, and the sight of the disbelievers is closed because they always do forbidden things. Every forbidden act they do will add to the tightness and strength of the lock that closes their hearts and ears. The more these deeds they do, the stronger the locks and seals on their hearts and ears become: So (We punished them), because they violated the agreement, and because of their disbelief in Allah's statements, and because they killed the prophets prophet without right (right reason), and because they say, \"Our hearts are closed.\" Actually Allah has locked their hearts because of their disbelief, because of that only a small part of them believe (an-Nisa'\/4: 155) And (similarly) We turned away their hearts and eyes like the first time they did not believe in Him (Al-Qur'an 'an), and We left them confused in error. (al-An'am\/6: 110) The process of increasing the strength of the lid and increasing the strength of the locks of the hearts and ears of the disbelievers is explained by the hadith: Rasulullah saw said, \"Verily, a servant when he commits a sinful act there is a black spot in the his heart, then if he repents, his heart will shine, and if he does more bad deeds, the black spot will increase.\" That's the word of God, \"No, but their deeds become a black stain on their hearts\".

			"tafsir": "In this verse, the third group is explained, namely the hypocrites, the group who claim that they have faith, but actually do not believe. Their confession is not true. They admit that this is to trick the eye and make fun of the Muslims. When the Prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina, many residents of Medina converted to Islam from the tribes of 'Aus and Khazraj and some Jews. At first this group is still not visible. But after the battle of Badr in the second year of Hijri, which brought victory to the Muslims, this hypocritical group began to emerge. Abdullah bin Ubay, a leader in Medina from the Khazraj tribe, the son of a man who had been the leader of the Aus and Khazraj tribes, was made by his followers the candidate for king in Medina. He told his followers, \"The present situation clearly indicates victory for Muhammad\". Then Abdullah bin Ubay and his followers declared that they converted to Islam but their hearts still hated them. Their goal is to destroy the Muslims from within, with various efforts and deceptions. Among them were many Jews. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The parable of the hypocrite is like a young goat (who is confused and doubtful) between two goats, going back and forth, sometimes following one, sometimes following the other. (Muslim history from Ibn Umar) They are not among those who have true faith and who feel the majesty of Allah, nor do they realize that Allah actually knows what they are doing physically and mentally. If they had believed in the true faith, they would not have done anything that offended the Prophet and the Muslims. They perform prayer and fasting services, just to deceive the public eye, while their hearts and souls actually do not live up to these services."

Deceiving Allah, His Messenger and believers is by showing faith, compassion and hiding enmity in the heart. They mingle with the Muslims, to spy on them and then pass it on to the enemies of Islam. They spread enmity and slander, to weaken the ranks of the Muslims. The attempt of the hypocrites failed and was in vain. Their hearts grow sad, sad and jealous, so that the right and honest considerations to judge the truth are increasingly disappearing from them. They are not really deceiving Allah, His Messenger and the believers, but they are deceiving themselves. As a result, their actions will fall on themselves, only they are not aware of it. Consciousness is the power of the soul to respond to something hidden, implied by the real or the unreal."

This disease will get worse, when accompanied by real actions. For example, feelings of sadness for someone will deepen if accompanied by real actions, such as crying, thrashing and so on. Such jealousy diseases are found in the souls of hypocrites. Therefore they are hostile to Allah and His Messenger, deceive with pretense and try to harm the Messenger and his people. Then the disease increased after seeing the Apostle's victories. Every time the Apostles won, their illnesses also increased. The disease of indecision and doubt, in particular, causes great stress to the hypocrites. Their minds grow weaker to respond to religious truth and understand it, even their senses are not able to perceive objects properly, as revealed by Allah in His words: \"They have hearts, but they do not use them to understand (verses of Allah) and they have eyes, (but) they do not use them to see (signs of Allah's power), and they have ears, (but) they do not use them to hear (the verses of Allah). They are like cattle, even more astray. They are the people people who are negligent \"(al-A'raf \/ 7: 179) The evidence has been evident, the bright light of truth is also clear to them, but they are reluctant to accept it, they even hold on to their old stance even tighter. The bright light darkened in their eyes and became a disease in their hearts. Their hearts grew saddened by the loss of their leadership. Envy and jealousy deepened because they witnessed the strength of Islam day by day. As a result of their lies, namely claiming to believe in Allah and the Last Day and their deceit against Allah, they will suffer a painful punishment. In this verse and the following verses, Allah explains some of the characteristics of hypocrites who carry out destructive actions, including helping disbelievers (enemies of Islam) by disclosing the secrets of Muslims, encouraging disbelievers immediately destroying the Muslims, entering into cooperative agreements with opponents of Islam, causing conflicts in society, inciting Muslims to leave the Prophet and so on.

The hypocrites see those who believe as stupid and weak-minded, like the Muhajirin who left their families and hometowns, they are even hostile towards their own families and slaves like Suhaib, Bilal, and Khabbab. The Ansar people were also seen as stupid because they distributed their property and wealth to the emigrants. Allah emphasizes that they are actually people who are weak in mind, because they do not use reason to respond to the truth and they are affected by their position in their people. They do not know faith and its essence, therefore they do not know whether the believers are stupid or smart. Faith will not be perfect except with certain knowledge.

But when they are in the midst of their (demons) friends, they also explain that what they have actually done is only to deceive and make fun of the Muslims. Their intentions do not change, they remain in their religion. The word \"demon\" comes from the word sytana which means \"far away\", satan means \"which is very far away\". The hypocrites are said to be devils because they are very far from Allah's guidance, far from virtue and goodness. The devil may be a human or a jinn, as stated in the word of Allah swt: And thus for every prophet We made an enemy consisting of human and jinn devils, some of them whispered to others beautiful words as a deception.

Their failure to hinder the progress of Islam aggravated the disease in their hearts so that they were no longer able to find and accept the truth that the Prophet Muhammad had brought. Therefore they are constantly in confusion, doubt and obstinacy and find no way out of the circle of delusion. Word of Allah swt: \".....

Allah said: And indeed, We have sent a messenger for every nation (to call), \"Worship Allah, and stay away from tagut.\" (an-Nahl\/16: 36) Each of the apostles began their preaching by calling on their people to worship Allah alone. For example, Allah swt said: \".... Then he (Noah) said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! There is no god (worship) for you besides Him. ¦\" (al-A'raf\/7: 59) Worshiping Allah is devoting oneself to Him, with full reverence, purifying obedience only to Him, because one feels that only Allah creates, controls, maintains and educates all creatures. The worship of a servant as mentioned above will be judged by Allah SWT according to the intention of the servant who performs it. In this verse Allah SWT is called \"Rabb\", then accompanied by the words \"¦who created you and those before you¦\" This gives understanding that Allah creates humans, breeds them, gives taufik, guards and maintains, and gives favors so that with these blessings humans can carry out their duties as servants of Allah. All these graces are given to humans from the beginning of their existence, until the end of their life in this world. whoever is grateful for Allah's favors, He will add to that favor, on the other hand, whoever denies Allah's favors, then he will receive the punishment in this world as He has inflicted on the previous peoples and in the Hereafter there will be a painful punishment. Allah swt said: And (remember) when your Lord announced, \"Indeed, if you are grateful, I will surely add (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then My punishment will be very severe.\" (Ibrahim\/14: 7) By worshiping Allah as commanded, humans will avoid Allah's punishment and they will reach a high and perfect degree."

Everything was created by Allah for humans, so that humans pay attention to the creation process, contemplate, study and process it so that it is beneficial for humans and humanity in accordance with what Allah has revealed. Allah clearly explains in this verse especially in the part that reveals And it is He who sends down water (rain) from the sky and then He produces with it (rain) fruits. In the light of Allah mentions that the earth, sky and heavenly bodies, such as the sun and stars are God's creations which are one unit and everything is governed by a single unified system which in modern science is called an ecosystem. As long as it hasn't been damaged by the hands of humans who indulge their desires, everything runs in an orderly and orderly manner. The vast sea which is illuminated by the hot sun then causes a lot of water vapor. This water vapor rises up to form clouds and clouds, then is spread by the wind throughout the earth's surface, so that this huge amount of water vapor over the mountains cools and then becomes dots and becomes rain that can irrigate the vast surface of the earth. not only does rain fall on the sea, but also on land, by means of the winds which disperse it. It is because of the rain that falls from the sky that the earth becomes fertile, various fruit plants, vegetables, grains and sweet potatoes and so on grow and provide many benefits for humans and all creatures on earth. In addition, the rain also causes rivers, lakes and wells to fill with water and increases the fertility of the earth. Dense forests also help channel water in the earth, help distribute fresh air, cool hot air and maintain the fertility of the earth. Humans by taking advantage of the development of science and technology can find out when it rains a lot and when it rarely rains or even doesn't rain at all, based on the position of the stars in the sky and wind circulation. It can also be known where fish gather in the sea, of which there are many types and varieties, and even where birds go in certain seasons. The following is an explanation by scientists\/scientists about the sky as a roof: A roof for a building is primarily needed so that the occupants who live in it are protected from rain and sun heat. In the context of the verse above the sky as a roof is a parable aimed at the earth where we live. Every time, the earth is bombarded by celestial bodies, which include meteorites. However, until now the earth has not been ravaged. This is because the earth is covered by gas or air which is called the atmosphere. Before reaching the earth, meteoroids will be broken apart and destroyed when they enter the atmosphere. Before reaching the atmosphere, the rays emitted by the sun break up the existing meteorites. It is this solar radiation that can blow up meteorites on their way to earth and then be absorbed by the ozone layer. Thus the atmosphere and the ozone layer are a safety cover or in other words it may be referred to as a roof for the earth. Earth cannot be inhabited by living things without the roof. Another verse which states the same thing is al-Anbiya'\/21: 32 which means: And We made the sky a roof that is preserved, but they still turn away from the signs (the greatness of Allah) that (the sun, the moon, the wind, the clouds and others). (al-Anbiya'\/21: 32) The thickness of the atmosphere reaches 560 kilometers, measured from the surface of the earth. Research on the atmosphere began by using natural phenomena that can be seen from Earth, such as the beautiful colors at sunrise and sunset, and the twinkling of stars. In recent years, using sophisticated equipment placed on satellites in outer space, we can better understand the atmosphere and its function for the earth. Overall, it can be said that life on earth is supported by three things, namely the existence of an atmosphere, the presence of energy that comes from sunlight, and the presence of the earth's magnetic field. The atmosphere is known to absorb most of the energy from sunlight, recycle water and some other chemical components, and cooperate with existing electric and magnetic charges to produce pleasant weather. The atmosphere also protects Earth's life from the vacuum and low temperature of outer space. The atmosphere consists of different layers of gases. The four layers can be distinguished by differences in temperature, differences in chemical composition, movements of chemicals within them, and differences in air density. The four layers are the Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Thermosphere, or it can also be divided into seven as described in al-Baqarah\/2: 29. The gas composition in the atmosphere mainly consists of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%) and argon (1%). Several components that are very influential on climate and weather are also present, although in very small amounts such as water vapor (0.25%), carbon dioxide (0.036%) and ozone (0.015%) Regarding wind, clouds and rainwater The relationship between wind and clouds which then produces rain can be explained by looking at the water cycle. The water cycle takes place starting from the evaporation of seawater which soars upward into clouds and then descends to the earth in the form of raindrops, then the water that falls in the form of rain returns to the sea via rivers and underground water. The Qur'an does not mention any such details about the water cycle, however, many verses describe some parts of the overall process with great accuracy. These include the two verses below. It is Allah who sends the winds, then the winds move the clouds and Allah spreads them across the sky according to what He wills, and makes them lumpy, then you see rain coming out of their gaps, then when He sends it down to His servants who He wanted them to suddenly be happy. (ar-Rum\/30: 48) Do you not see that Allah causes the clouds to move slowly, then collects them, then He makes them pile up, then you see rain coming out of their gaps, and He (also) sends down (drops) ice from the sky, (that is) from (clumps of clouds like) mountains, then He inflicts it on whom He wills and avoids Him from whom He wills. The flash of lightning almost blinded the sight. (an-Nur\/24: 43) The two verses above describe the stages in the formation of clouds which produce rain, which in turn, is one of the stages in the water cycle. By looking more closely at the two verses above, it is evident that there are two phenomena. One is cloud spreading and another is cloud pooling. Two opposing processes occur so that rain clouds can form. These two processes mentioned in the Qur'an were only discovered by modern meteorology about 200 years ago. There are two types of clouds that can produce rain. Both can be classified based on their shape, namely stratus (layered type) and cumulus (accumulated type). In layered cloud types, two important stages that occur are stratus and nimbostratus cloud types (nimbo means rain). The first verse above (ar-Rum\/30: 48), very clearly provides information about layered cloud formations. This type of cloud only forms when the wind blows gradually and slowly lifts the cloud up. Furthermore, the clouds will be shaped like layers that expand (\"It is Allah who sends the wind, then the wind moves the clouds and Allah spreads them across the sky.....\"). If the conditions are suitable, (among other things if the temperature is low enough and the moisture content is high enough) then the water droplets will coalesce and become larger water droplets. We can see this process as a blackening of the cloud. In the Quraish Shihab translation, this part is stated as: \"......and made it lumpy....\". But in the English translation of the Koran, this part is idd as: \"....and makes them dark...\". Finally, raindrops will fall from the clouds: \"...then you see the rain coming out of the gaps....\". The second type of cloud that can produce rain is the stacked type of cloud. These clouds are divided based on their shape in several names, namely cumulus, cumulonimbus and stratocumulus. This cloud is characterized by its lumpy shape and stacked on top of each other. Cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds are clumpy types, while stratocumulus is not clumpy, slightly thinned and widened. The second verse (an-Nur\/24: 43) describes the formation of this type of cloud. This type of cloud is formed by violent winds that point up and down (\"....that God moved the clouds...\"). In the English translation of the Koran, this part of the verse is idd as: \"...drives clouds with force...\". Pushing the clouds hard. When a cloudburst occurs, they coalesce into a giant cloud mass, piled on top of one another. At this point, cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds can produce rain. The next sentence of this verse seems to describe specifically the occurrence of cumulonimbus, a cloud condition known as a storm cloud. These towering piles of clouds when viewed from below are similar to the shape of a mountain. By soaring high into the sky, the water droplets that have formed will freeze into ice grains (\"..... ..then He makes them pile up, then you see rain coming out of the gaps, and He (also) sends down (the grains) grains of) ice from the sky, (ie) from (clumps of clouds like) mountains...\"), cumulonimbus clouds also produce God's creation which is very valuable, namely lightning (\"...the flash of lightning almost eliminates vision.\") Another verse related to the water cycle that is related to other stages outside of rain is Surah Gafir\/23: 18 which means the following: And We send down water from the sky with a measure; then We caused the water to settle on the earth, and surely We have power to make it disappear. (Gafir \/23: 18) This verse clearly states that rainwater is absorbed by the soil but does not disappear. This means that groundwater can still flow. The two verses below also describe how water flows, namely surface flow (ar-Ra'd\/13: 17) and groundwater flow (az-Zumar\/39: 21) which means this: Allah has sent down water (rain) from the sky, then it (water) flows in the valleys according to its size, then the current carries floating foam. And from what (metal) they melt in the fire to make jewelry or tools, there is (also) foam like that (flow foam). Thus Allah makes parable about the right and wrong. As for the scum, it will disappear as useless; but that which is beneficial to man, will remain on earth. Thus God made a parable. (ar-Ra'd\/13: 17) Have you not noticed that Allah sends down water from the sky, then He arranges it into sources of water on earth, then with that water \"plants of various colors\" grow, then He made it broken, scattered. Indeed, in that there is a lesson for those who have common sense. (az-Zumar\/39: 21) There are many other verses in the Qur'an that talk about the water cycle, such as Gafir \/40:13; al-Mu'minÅ«n \/23: 18; al-Furqan\/25: 48; al-'Ankabut\/29: 63, and others. All of these verses state things that intersect with the various verses referred to above. Several other verses also talk about water, but in a different context, as can be seen in surah al-Waqi'ah\/56: 68-70 which means: Have you ever paid attention to the water you drink? Did you send it down from the clouds or did We send it down? If We had willed, We would have made it salty. Why are you not grateful? (al-Waqi'ah\/56: 68-70) This verse in the form of a question sentence emphasizes human powerlessness in the oldest dream of controlling rain. The facts show that artificial rain cannot be held if clouds with certain conditions are not available. The cloud must have a certain amount of various particles, a high water content carried by the upward wind, and there is an upward development of the cloud pile. If all of these characters are present in the cloud, then artificial rain can be carried out. However, meteorologists still question the effectiveness of this method. The verses related to the next water cycle are the verses that explain the major rivers and oceans. And it is He who let the two seas flow (side by side); one is fresh and fresh and the other is salty and bitter, and He made between them an impenetrable wall and boundary. (al-Furqan\/25: 53) The description of major rivers, large river estuaries and seas is proclaimed in the form of the taste of the water by the verse above. In river mouths or estuaries, there is a combination of fresh water and salt water. But how to mix it is very unique. Fresh water that is spilled into the sea will remain fresh until it is far out to sea, before it really mixes with salt water. Mixing occurred far from the mouth of the river in the middle of the sea. One more verse related (indirectly) to the rain is at-tur\/52: 44 which means: And when they see wisps of clouds falling from the sky, they say: Those are lumpy clouds. (at-tur \/52: 44) This verse came down to answer the challenge of some unbelievers so that the Prophet Muhammad dropped the sky on their heads. They suspect that the sky is a slab or piece that forms the roof of the world. Allah does not answer their challenge here and explains that they will only find clouds. Something they would not be able to understand at that time. Believers are only commanded by Allah to maintain the conservation of this nature, because many disbelievers and disobedient people misuse science to destroy nature. Believers as khalifatullah fil ardh are tasked with protecting the environment and using it to achieve the benefits of life so that every human being can enjoy and be grateful for prosperity and happiness. Because Allah is the one who gives these blessings, humans are obliged to worship Allah alone. Allah gives all these blessings so that humans are pious and carry out their duties as a servant of Allah. These tasks can be understood from the word of God: I did not create jinn and humans except that they worship Me. (adz-dzariyat\/51: 56) Allah swt tests humans in carrying out the tasks assigned to them, with His words: Who created death and life, to test you, which of you is better in deeds. ¦(al-Mulk\/67: 2) Because humans already know the commandments and know about the oneness and power of Allah, then Allah gives a warning, \"Do not make humans create other gods besides Allah and do not say that Allah is numbering. \""

The characteristics of good news are news that can cause joy in the truest sense for those who receive or hear the news. \"Good news\" is only addressed to those who work and try their best according to the goals outlined by religion. That's why Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad to convey the good news to those who believe and do good. The faith that God values is a living faith, namely faith that is proven by good deeds. Conversely, Allah does not respect charity if it is not based on true faith. \"Charity\" (deed) is to carry out an act or work, either in the form of words, actions or a pledge of the heart, but what is commonly understood from the word \"charity\" is the act of limbs. Good deeds embody good deeds as determined by religion. In the verse above, Allah SWT mentions the words \"faith\" and \"doing good\", because \"doing good\" is the result of \"faith\". The verse above also mentions the reward that will be received by those who believe, namely heaven with all the pleasures contained therein. \"Heaven\" according to the language means \"garden\" which is beautiful with colorful plants, attracting the hearts of those who see it. What is meant by \"heaven\" here is a place reserved for believers in the hereafter. Heaven is a realm of the unseen, its essence is not known by humans, only Allah knows it. What needs to be believed is that heaven is a place full of physical and spiritual enjoyment provided for believers. This form of enjoyment cannot be compared to worldly pleasures."

			"tafsir": "Indeed, Allah does not hesitate to make examples and parables in explaining information with a mosquito or even smaller than that. Believers believe in the truth and wisdom of Allah, they can certainly accept this information. but the disbelievers and the hypocrites do not want to understand the purpose of Allah SWT in making parables in the Qur'an. The parable aims to clarify the meaning of a word or sentence by comparing the content or meaning of the word or sentence with something that is already known and understood. In biology, animals, plants and even human organs are discussed a lot and all of that needs to be known by humans, some are beneficial and some are harmful to humans. Not only large animals such as elephants, tigers and lions that need to be known, but small animals such as flies, mosquitoes and caterpillars also need to know their benefits and dangers. Mosquitoes, for example, there are dangerous ones such as anaphex which spreads malaria and Aedes aegypti which spreads dengue fever, but there are mosquitoes which are not as dangerous as culex. Anaphex mosquitoes live in dirty water but Aedes aegypti mosquitoes live in clean water. Allah is truly Almighty and All-Wise. In every dangerous creature, a predator has been created, namely another type of animal that likes to prey on and kill it. Against mosquitoes, for example, there are several predators such as frogs, lizards, geckos and others. We must not kill the predators and we should know where mosquitoes breed, we need to understand the wisdom and power of Allah. When humans are invited to pay attention to the creation of themselves, the Qur'an in many verses encourages humans to examine nature and see God's signs in it. The universe, with its elements of animate and non-living things, is a sign of creation. All creation exists only to display the power, knowledge and artistry possessed by that \"creator\", Allah swt. All of creation displays such signs. This includes small animals such as mosquitoes, as can be seen in the verse above. When we try to understand the life of mosquitoes, we will know how complicated and complex the system that runs. In general, we know that this creature is a blood sucker of humans and other animals. However, such knowledge is not entirely correct. Because not all individual mosquitoes live from sucking blood. Only female mosquitoes need blood in their diet. The need for blood has nothing to do with this type of eating habits. The main connection is with its breeding. Female mosquitoes need protein from the blood in the final process of egg formation. In other words, the female mosquito sucks blood to ensure the continuation of its kind. The process of mosquito development is one amazing aspect. These animals change from larvae to mosquitoes after going through several different phases. Female mosquitoes will lay their eggs on damp leaves or damp areas around stagnant water. Before doing that, the female mosquito will inspect the area using the organs located in the abdomen. This organ is able to detect humidity and temperature. After finding a suitable area, then the female mosquito lays her eggs. Eggs less than 1 mm long are laid in groups or singly. There are several types of mosquitoes that string up to 300 eggs in the form of a raft, and placed on stagnant water. Eggs that are laid with great care will change color. The color change occurs just a few hours after being laid. The color becomes black. With this color, the camouflage value of the eggs is quite high and it escapes the attention of predators, such as birds or other predatory insects. After hatching, the young mosquitoes immediately swim in the water. The life span in water begins for mosquito larvae. These puppies will get bigger. Existing skin can no longer cover his body. They shed this skin or shell, and form a new shell. This change of skin or shell occurs two or three times at this time. In life in water, mosquito larvae have completely different organs when they become mosquitoes. In life in water, they have a kind of hair that grows around the mouth. With this hair movement, the larvae can direct the microorganisms in the waters to the mouth. To breathe, they use a tube-shaped respirator located on their back. They take in oxygen when they are upside down on the surface of the water. To prevent water from entering the tube, the mosquito larvae secrete a sticky liquid that prevents water from entering. Without the existence of these tools, the larvae will not be able to survive in the water. At the last molt, the shape of the larva changes drastically, taking on a completely different form. This period is known as the \"pupa\" period. They are ready to become \"real\" mosquitoes. The changes are such that it is hard to believe that this was done by one individual and of a kind. The changes are so complex, that it seems that the creature itself cannot be done perfectly. At this time, two new breathing tubes or pipes will grow in the head to replace the existing tubes in the back. If there is no new tube on the head, by changing the shape and position of the creature in the water, then if there is only a tube on the back, it is clear that the mosquito \"pupa\" will die. This is because because of its position, the water will enter the tube on its back. During the \"pupa\" period, about three to four days, the mosquito larvae that live in the cocoons will fast. In this cocoon, the larval form turns into a full-fledged adult mosquito, complete with wings, chest, abdomen, legs, antennae, eyes, and so on. Then the cocoon will split at the top. This period is a very vulnerable period for mosquitoes. The condition for mosquitoes to fly is not to be exposed to water. Only the bottom of the feet will touch the water. That is why, the cocoon that is open at the top will be covered with a sticky liquid, which prevents water from entering the cocoon. Half an hour after leaving the cocoon, the mosquito will make its first flight. When the larvae metamorphose into mosquitoes, they are equipped with a sophisticated set of systems to be able to live and continue their offspring. Mosquitoes are equipped with organs that can be used to detect changes in temperature, air, humidity and odor. In fact, mosquitoes have the ability to \"see through changes in temperature\" which helps them when searching for their prey, even when it is very dark. The mosquito technique of \"sucking blood\" turns out to be a very complex and delicate set of systems. To slice through the skin of its prey, it uses six slicing \"blades\" that work like saws. During the cutting process, the mosquito splashes a liquid on the wound it makes. This liquid numbs the injured prey's body parts, while preventing the blood from clotting. Thus, the prey will not feel disturbed, in addition to the blood-sucking process running smoothly. If one of the organs does not work properly, then the mosquito will have difficulty obtaining food and continuing and maintaining its kind. With such a body design, even though it \"only\" exists in small mosquitoes, this is proof of the work of creation. In the Qur'an, this tiny mosquito is used as an example to show Allah's power. Those who believe understand, while those who disbelieve deny it. According to Ibn 'Abbas, this verse was revealed in connection with the accusation of the Jews that the parables in the Qur'an have no significant value, because in these parables something meaningless is mentioned, even including small and despicable animals, such as dzubab which means flies (al-Hajj\/22:73) and ankabut which means spider (al-'Ankabut\/29:41). But if the Jews knew the meaning of the parable, they would surely state that the parables in the Qur'an are correct and true parables as in al-'Ankabut\/29:41: The parable of those who take protection -protector other than Allah is like a spider that makes a house. And actually the weakest house is the spider's house, if they know. In this verse, polytheists are likened to spiders, their faith in what they worship is likened to fragile cobwebs which they make as a shelter from all harm. Even though the slightest hit by the wind the nest will be damaged and destroyed. In making parables for Allah there is no difference between the small and the great, the lowly and the wrathful, all are God's creatures. What is important is that the parable achieves its purpose. With the revelation of this verse, it turns out that the accusations of the Jews had no good reason. As for the believers, their hearts have been filled with the taufik and guidance of Allah and they know that these parables are from Allah, but the disbelievers deny them and they are even astonished at hearing these parables, the disbelievers and the hypocrites become more arrogant and disavow because of it. Allah misleads disbelievers and hypocrites by allowing them to choose paths of misguidance after having explained to them the path of truth. Because they disavow and do not want to understand and think about Allah's instructions, they follow paths that He does not approve of. As a result, they are subject to a painful punishment, because of their wickedness. People who do not use their minds and knowledge to parables given by Allah swt, they face it with arrogance which causes them to go astray. They were not guided and went astray because of their wickedness. On the other hand, those who have faith in their hearts, use their minds and minds, will receive guidance from these parables."

The sentence \"He went to the sky, then He perfected it into seven heavens\" gives the meaning that God created the earth and everything in it for humans, God created the heavens and then God perfected them to become seven heavens. This is confirmed in the word of Allah: Then He went up to the sky and (the sky) was still smoke, then He said to him and to the earth, \"Come both of you according to My orders obediently or forced.\" The two replied, \"We came obediently.\" (Fussilat\/41: 11) So the first sky that God created before creating the earth at that time was still a thick billowing smoke and the temperature was very hot. Both are heaven and earth. To be called means to determine the terms and process of work by God so that they work together in synergy and create a harmonious nature. In verse 29 it is explained that Allah perfected the one sky and it was still in the form of smoke to become seven heavens. The number seven in Arabic can mean six plus one, it can also mean a lot more than just six plus one. If we take the first meaning (six plus one), it means that Allah made the heavens which were once one layer into seven layers, or Allah made the heavenly bodies which were only one into seven heavenly bodies. Each of these celestial bodies revolves around the sun according to its path in a fixed orbit so that nothing collides. But the sun only rotates and circulates on its axis because the sun is the center of this solar system. Indeed, Allah is the Most Rich and the Most Wise in managing this great and vast nature. In the understanding of astronomy, the sky is the entire space of the universe, in which there are various celestial bodies including the sun, earth, planets, galaxies, superclusters, and so on. This was stated by Allah in Surah al-Mulk\/67: 5, which means: ¦Indeed, We have adorned the near sky (the sky of the world) with stars, and We made the stars throwing tools for the devil, and We provide for them the torment of a flaming Hell ¦ (al-Mulk\/67: 5) So, the sky that contains the stars is indeed called the sky of the world. That's the sky we know so far. And that is what astronomers have studied so far, which is estimated to be about 30 billion light years in diameter. And contains trillions of celestial bodies on an infinite scale. However, it turns out that God calls the sky that is so big and terrible that it is only a part of the world's sky, and maybe the first sky. So where are the second to seventh heavens? So far there have been no \"unsought after\" scientific findings regarding the relationship between the number seven and the \"sky\" known in the world of science as the universe. Indeed there are several scales of celestial bodies, for example in one solar system (solar system) there is a \"sun\" (a star at the center of the solar system in question) and there are planets and their satellites. Billions of solar systems form galaxies. Billions of galaxies make up the universe. This is only six. To make it seven, one could add the dimensions of the universe, namely that the entire universe contains a number of universes. So there are seven dimensions in nature, and this is probably what is meant by the seven heavens. But the problem is that during the pilgrimage of the Prophet Muhammad, he went through layer by layer of the heavens serially, from the first layer, to the second layer, and so on up to the seventh layer, and finally left the creature's realm towards Sidratil-Muntaka. So layer upon layer of heaven is like a cake of successive layers, from within (the first layer) to the seventh layer. This fact is different from scientific findings. T. Djamaluddin, one of the Indonesian astronomers, tends to understand the \"seven heavens\" as countless celestial bodies and not layers. In Arabic, the number seven is usually used to describe a very large number. On the other side of the seven heavens, there are probably seven layers of the atmosphere close to this earth, namely: (1) Troposphere, (2) Tropopause, (3) Stratosphere, (4) Stratopause. ), (5) Mesosphere (Mesosphere), (6) Mesopause (Mesopause), and (7) Thermosphere (Thermosphere). This division is based on the temperature (temperature) of each layer of the atmosphere and its distance from the earth's surface. These layers are solid in the sense that they cover and protect our globe solidly because of the earth's gravitational force. (See also the scientific interpretation of Surah ar-Ra'd\/13: 2, Surah an-Naba'\/78: 12.) In the interpretation of Surah ar-Ra'd\/13: 2, the division of the layers of the atmosphere is explained slightly differently from what is described here. , where the Ionosphere and Exosphere are united in the Thermosphere. However, if the understanding of the seven heavens in this case is associated with the Mi'raj of the Prophet Muhammad, it seems inappropriate. The seven heavens may also be interpreted as the Seven Dimensions of Space-Time in the Kaluza-Klein Theory (KKT). In Physics there are four (4) Fundamental Forces that exist in this universe, namely Electromagnetic Force, Weak Nuclear Force, Strong Nuclear Force, and Gravitational Force. If these four Forces were formed from the Big Bang of a Singularity, then these four forces must have previously 'unified as One Single Force (Grand Unified Force), this is what is known in the Grand Unified Theory (GUT, Theory of Oneness). Great). KKT explains that in order to be able to explain the unity of the four forces, the existence of the space-time geometry that we are in today is not enough. The geometry of space-time that we live in today can only say so much about Electromagnetic forces and in some cases Gravitational Forces. In order to be able to explain these four styles, the KKT stated that there must be seven other time-space dimensions. Thus with the four dimensions that are already known, namely: line, plane, space and time; then the total dimensions are eleven dimensions (11 dimensions). This statement is based on Mathematical-Physical calculations. Based on this KKT, scientists have also been able to calculate the diameter of one of the space-time dimensions, which is 10-32 cm, so that dimension is very small. Thus, it is impossible with the instruments that exist today that we can penetrate the other seven dimensions of space-time. The Kaluza-Klein Theory has provided a description of the existence of Seven Space-Time Dimensions, all of which will establish the geometry of the universe with its four fundamental forces. Could it be that the seven heavens are the seven dimensions of space-time according to the Kaluza-Klein Theory? Wallahu a'lam bis-sawab. At the end of the verse Allah says, \"And He is All-Knower of all things\", meaning that this universe is governed by Allah's laws, whether things are small or large, visible or invisible. Everything is arranged, controlled and known by Allah. This verse suggests that humans seek knowledge to think about all kinds of God's creations, so that they can increase their faith and purify their obedience to God."

Angels consider themselves more deserving of this position, because they are creatures who always glorify, praise and purify Allah SWT. Allah swt did not justify their assumption, and He replied that He knew what the angels did not know. Everything that Allah swt will do is based on the knowledge and wisdom of the Most High even though they cannot know it, including the appointment of Adam as caliph on earth. What is meant by Adam's caliphate on earth is his position as caliph on this earth, to carry out His commands, and prosper the earth and make use of all that is in it. This understanding can be strengthened by the words of Allah: \"¦. O David! Verily, We have made you the caliph (ruler) on earth ¦\" (sad\/38: 26) As we know, David as besides being a prophet was also a king for his people. This verse is the argument for the obligation of Muslims to elect and appoint a supreme leader as a unifying figure among all Muslims who can lead the ummah to carry out God's laws on this earth. Scholars have mentioned the conditions that must be possessed by the leader in question, including: being fair and knowledgeable which enables him to act as a judge and mujtahid, not having physical disabilities, and having sufficient experience, and not being partial in carrying out laws.

Humans are indeed creatures that can be educated (educable), and even have to be educated (educandus), because when a new human baby is born he cannot do anything, his limbs and brain and mind are still weak. But after going through the process of educating human babies who cannot do anything, they then develop and through good education humans can do anything. Adam was the first human being and no other human had educated him, so Allah directly educated and taught him. Moreover, Adam was prepared to become a caliph, namely a leader on earth. But God's way of educating and teaching Adam was not like humans teaching others, but by teaching directly and giving him the potential to develop in the form of his thinking power so that it was possible to know all the names before him. After He taught these names to Adam, Allah showed the objects to the angels and He commanded them to mention the names of these objects which had been taught to Adam and it turned out that they could not pronounce them. This is to show the limited knowledge of the angels and so that they know the superiority of Adam as a human over them, and so that they know the height of Allah's wisdom in choosing humans as caliphs. This also shows that the position of caliph, which is to regulate everything and uphold truth and justice on this earth, requires a lot of knowledge, ability and strong thinking."

Him, and they repented to Him. They also believed that everything that God did was based on His knowledge and wisdom, the Most High and Most Perfect, including the matter of Adam's appointment as caliph. They know that their knowledge is only limited to what He teaches them. Thus vanished their doubts about God's wisdom in the appointment of Adam to be caliph on earth. From the confessions of these angels, it can be understood that the question they originally asked \"why did Allah appoint Adam as caliph,\" was not a rebuttal from them against Allah's will, but merely a question asking for an explanation. After the explanation was given, they acknowledged their weakness, so they humbly and obediently obeyed Allah's will, especially in the appointment of Adam as, to become caliph. They praise Allah SWT, because He has given knowledge to them according to their abilities. Furthermore, they also confess with full confidence, and surrender to the knowledge of Allah, the Most Extensive and His Wisdom, the Most High. Then they emphasized that only Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise. This contains a lesson that humans who have been gifted with more knowledge than what is given to angels and other creatures, should always be grateful for these blessings, and not become arrogant and arrogant because of the knowledge they have, as well as the strength and power of their mind. . This is because, no matter how high human science and technology is in our day and age, there are still many natural secrets created by God that human science has not been able to reach, for example, the essence of the spirit that exists in man himself. Allah has warned that the knowledge bestowed upon human beings is very little compared to the knowledge of Allah and His essence. \"¦and you were not given knowledge, but a little.\" (a1-Isra'\/17: 85) As long as humans remain aware of their lack of knowledge, of course he will not become arrogant and arrogant, and surely he will not hesitate to admit his lack of knowledge about something if he really does not know it, and he will not feel ashamed to learn it to those who know. On the other hand, if he has knowledge about something useful, then he will not hide that knowledge, but will teach and develop it to others, so that they too can benefit from it."

			"tafsir": "After it turned out that the angels did not know and could not name the objects that Allah had shown them, Allah ordered Adam (as) to tell them the names. Adam carried out the order and then he told them the names. Then, after Adam had finished telling the angels the names, and also explaining the characteristics and features of each creature, Allah said to the angels that He had told them that He actually knew what they were saying. manifest by their utterances and the thoughts which they hide in their hearts. He creates something not in vain, but based on His knowledge and wisdom. In the matter of appointing Adam as caliph on earth, there is a high meaning of divine wisdom that is unknown to the angels. They cannot know the secrets of nature, as well as the characteristics that exist in each creature, because angels are very different from humans. They do not have any needs, such as clothing, food and property. So if angels were made the inhabitants and rulers of this earth, surely there would be no rice fields and fields, there would be no factories and mines, there would be no towering buildings. There will also not be as many kinds of science and technology as mankind has achieved so far, which are almost countless. With the power of his mind, humans can have knowledge and abilities that are constantly evolving and can do almost countless things. With that power, humans can discover new things that did not exist before. He can cultivate arid land into fertile soil. With the materials available on this earth, humans can create new variations that have never existed. The mating of a horse with a donkey gave birth to a new type of animal that had never existed before, namely an animal called a \"mule\". By crossing or crossing plants with white flowers and red flowers, a new type of plant is born, which has red and white flowers. Processing of metals into various kinds of jewelery and tools for daily living and processing of various kinds of plants to become clothing and food materials for their welfare. In this day and age one can witness millions of kinds of objects invented by humans, both small and large, as a result of the power of their minds. As for the angels, they do not have a passion that will encourage them to work on these natural objects and use them for the benefit of their lives. Therefore, if those who have been endowed with the power of reason and such talents and abilities are appointed as caliphs on earth, then this is natural, and also shows the perfection of knowledge and the height of Allah's wisdom in managing His creatures. The series of verses above emphasizes that the task of humans on earth is to become caliphs. When knowing Allah's intention to make caliphs on earth, the angels wondered why Allah wanted to make humans caliphs, even though they did a lot of damage and shed blood for each other? Allah replied that He knows what the angels do not know. It turns out that what makes humans worthy of carrying out the task of being caliphs on earth is because of the gift that Allah has given to humans in the form of the ability to know the names of all objects as well as remember them and explain them, while angels do not have this ability. If examined more deeply, the ability to identify and give names is essentially a basic ability that is needed by humans to develop science. Analysis and synthesis activities to produce knowledge cannot be carried out without the ability to identify and name. Therefore, the chapter or topic that becomes the initial discussion of logic and the philosophy of science is about \"names\", about the nature of names and the relationship between names and the concepts referred to by them. The ability to give names, both concrete and abstract ones, is essentially the ability to create concepts which in turn facilitates the ability to see the interrelationships between various concepts and to synthesize various concepts into new concepts. This process occurs continuously and in this way knowledge continues to accumulate and develop. It is very difficult to imagine the development of science if humans do not have the ability to name or construct concepts. If the ability to develop knowledge makes humans fit to carry out the duties of caliph on earth, then it is understandable if Allah SWT bestows a high degree on knowledgeable humans. Allah says which means: ¦ Allah will exalt those who believe among you and those who are given some degree of knowledge. (al-Mujjadi\/58: 11) Furthermore, see also Surah al-hijr\/15: 26, 28 and 33 which are related to the creation of humans, which means: And indeed, We have created man (Adam) from dry clay from shaped black mud. (al-hijr\/15: 26) And (remember), when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will create a man from dry clay from black mud that is given a form\". (al-hijr\/15: 28) He (Iblis) said, \"I will never prostrate to a human that You have created from dry clay from black mud that is given a shape\". (al-hijr\/15: 33) The question is why was Adam able to explain the names of these objects, while the Angels were not able to? In several surahs, including Surah al-Hijr above, Allah SWT explains that humans are made from clay. Soil contains many metal (metal) and metalloid (metal-like) atoms or elements which are needed as catalysts in chemical and biochemical reaction processes to form more complex organic molecules. Examples of elements in the soil include iron (Fe), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn) etc. Also in the presence of the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and oxygen (O), the metal and metalloid elements above are able to become catalysts in biochemical reaction processes to form molecules that are more complex such as urea, amino acids or even nucleotides. These molecules are known as organic molecules, supporting life processes. The human brain, which is an important organ for receiving information, then storing it, and retrieving it; made of the chemical elements above, which are arranged into macro-molecules and brain tissue. Another information storage instrument possessed by humans is the chemical compound known as DNA or desoxyribonucleic acid: desoxyribonucleic acid. Both human brain tissue and DNA molecules consist of the main elements C, H, O, N and P. Prof. Carl Sagan from Princeton University, USA in his book The Dragon of Eden gives an illustration that humans are indeed superior when compared to other creatures created by Allah SWT. One of the advantages is that humans are equipped with an information \/ memory storage system. There are two kinds of information storage systems in humans, namely: (1) Brain Network, which stores whatever information it can record. The human brain has the ability to store as much as 1013 bits or 107 Gbits of information. Store information to (2). Chromosomal DNA, namely DNA molecules in chromosomes, which store human genetic information. This information will be transferred or passed on to their descendants. Human chromosomal DNA is capable of storing as much as 2x1010 bits of memory or about 2x104 Gbits. The capacity to store human DNA-chromosomal information is comparable to a 2,000,000-page book, or equivalent to 4,000 book volumes @ 500 pages. These two sophisticated memory storages are made of elements that are in the ground, subhanallah. This is the answer, why Adam was able to grasp and understand everything that was taught by Allah SWT, in the form of the names of objects; and re-express it properly; because Adam is equipped with instruments for storing and re-expressing memory: brain tissue and DNA which are made up of the elements of the soil; whereas angels are not like that. Satan is proud, because of his stupidity in understanding Allah's creation, by harassing the element of earth."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is explained that Allah ordered the angels to prostrate or pay respects to Adam as. So the angels obeyed that order, except for Satan, meaning that after Adam as finished telling the names of these creatures to the angels, Allah ordered them to prostrate or give respect for Adam as So bow down to Adam as the angel. In Islam, prostration of worship is only permissible to Allah SWT alone. In essence, there are two kinds of prostration to Allah. First, prostration of humans to God in worship, namely prostration of prayer, prostration of recitations and prostration of thanksgiving according to ways that have been determined in the teachings of the Shari'a. Second, prostrate all creatures to Allah with the meaning of submission and obedience to Him. The original meaning of the words \"sujud\" is \"submit and obey\". And plants and trees, both are subject (to Him). (ar-Rahman\/55: 6) And all prostrations to Allah, both in the heavens and on earth, either of their own volition or forced ¦ (ar-Ra'd\/13: 15) The prostration of the angels to Adam as a tribute and declaration of submission to him, not to worship. Allah's command to them to bow down to Adam showed Adam's superiority over them, so that he really had more right to be made caliph on earth. Regarding the origin of the incident of Adam, the angels and the Devil, it is stated that Adam was created by Allah from dust and the angels were created from light (nur), while the jinn, devils and devils were created from fire (nar). Devils and satans always whisper to people things that are not true to tempt and lead them astray from the straight path. Even Adam and Eve as the first humans have been tempted to violate Allah's prohibition. The devil is not a type of angel, but a creature from the jinn nation. The devil was originally among the angels, associated with them and had characteristics like them too, even though his origins were different from those of the angels. The proof is the word of Allah swt at the end of the verse which explains that when Allah swt ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam as, they all obeyed, except for the Devil. So it is clear that Satan is not from among the angels, because angels are always obedient and obedient to God's commands and never disobey. The literal meaning of \"devil\" is \"despair,\" \"disobey,\" \"be still,\" or \"remorse.\" In another verse Allah says: And (remember) when We said to the angels, \"You bow down to Adam!\" So they bowed down except for Iblees. He is from the (group of) jinn, so he disobeys the command of his Lord…(al-Kahf\/18: 50) Devils, as well as jinns and demons, were created by God from fire. The devil thinks that fire is nobler than earth. Therefore he saw himself as more noble than Adam, because Adam was created by God from dust. That is why Satan refused to prostrate to Adam. There is another opinion that says that the Devil is also a type of angel, because God's command to the angels to prostrate to Adam AS is addressed to all angels. Then it was stated, that the angels all prostrated to Adam as, except for Satan. It is true, that the original nature of the angels is obedient and obedient to Allah swt. However, it is not impossible that some or one of them is disobedient, as a trait that comes later. That's the Devil. In another verse it is stated that Allah asked Satan what his reason was for not prostrating to Adam. Allah said: (Allah) said, \"O Devil, what prevents you from bowing down to what I have created with My power. Are you arrogant or do you (feel) among the (higher) class?\" (sad\/38:75) Allah narrates the Devil's answer: (Satan) said, \"I am better than him, because You created me from fire, while You created him from clay.\" (sad\/38:76) Iblis was reluctant to obey God's command to prostrate to Adam, and he acted arrogantly because he felt he was more noble and more entitled than Adam to be made caliph. Because Satan rejects God's commands based on that assumption, he is one of the creatures who disbelieve in God. There is even an opinion that says that the Devil is a creature that first disobeys God's commands. There is also an opinion that says that the Devil is the origin of all jinn, as Adam is the origin of all humans. The genie has offspring. They were the inhabitants of the earth before Adam was created by Allah and they have done damage to the earth. That is why, when Allah told the angels that He would make Adam the caliph on earth, the angels said, \"Are you going to make caliphs on earth for people who like to do damage and like to shed blood? So the angels thought that humans would also act like the jinn when they rule the earth."

Regarding the paradise mentioned in this verse, most commentators say that the paradise referred to in this verse is heaven in the sky which Allah promised as a reward for those who believe and do good deeds. According to other interpreters, the paradise mentioned in the verse is a garden, where Adam and his wife lived and were given enough enjoyment of life. In this verse it is explained that Adam as and his wife are allowed to enjoy any food and anywhere in heaven safely and freely, it's just that Allah forbade them to approach and eat the fruit of a certain tree which is only one tree among many other trees. it's in heaven. Satan named the tree the tree of immortality, because according to him, if Adam and his wife ate the fruit of the tree, they would be able to live forever in heaven. In fact, the opposite is true, that is, if he and his wife eat the fruit of the tree, they will be expelled from heaven, because that is a violation of Allah's prohibition. If they violate the prohibition, then they are included in the class of people who are unjust to themselves, and will receive punishment from Allah SWT which will result in them losing the honor and happiness they have earned. In this verse Allah does not explain the nature of the tree. Someone will not be able to determine it without any definite reason. After all, the main purpose of this story has been achieved without providing any information about the nature of the tree. But it can be said that Allah's prohibition against Adam and his wife to approach the tree and eat its fruit, of course, is based on a wisdom from Him, which is a test from Allah to Adam and his wife."

Shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that will not perish?\" (taha\/20: 120) In another of His words, the devil's seduction is also mentioned: ¦ And (satan) said, \"Your God only forbids the two of you to approach this tree, so that you both do not become angels or do not become immortal people (in heaven).\" (al-A'raf\/7: 20) In carrying out the temptation, Satan tried to convince Adam that he was really only giving good advice and for that he swore: \"Surely I am really one of your advisers. \" (al-A'raf\/7: 21) Because of the mistake that Adam and his wife had made, Allah swt removed them from the pleasures and glory they had obtained so far, then Allah swt ordered them to descend from heaven to earth. Since then they and Satan have always been in a state of enmity with each other. Furthermore, Allah explained that they would have a place to live and enjoy life on earth until their death. Thus, no one will live forever on earth. It is clear that the lies of Satan's whispers to Adam and his wife, that by eating the fruit of the tree they will live forever in heaven. In this verse there is a hint that Adam as was sent out with his wife from heaven to earth not to destroy them, but so that they work to prosper this earth, and not keep them away from the pleasures of life, because even on earth they are still blessed with pleasures; and not to live forever, because one day they will die and leave this mortal world."

If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will surely be among the -people who lose.\" (al-A'raf\/7: 23) After Adam prayed to Allah for forgiveness by saying these words, Allah accepted his repentance, and bestowed His mercy on Adam. Verily, Allah is Most Repentant and Most Merciful. Because Allah always forgives and pardons and His mercy to those who repent of their mistakes. Repentance that God accepts is repentance that fulfills the following: 1. Regret and leave all the mistakes that have been made. 2. Stay away from and not repeat such mistakes and actions. 3. Accompanying the sinful act with good deeds. In this case the Prophet Muhammad had said: \"Accompany those evil deeds with good deeds, surely those good deeds will wash away his sins.\" (History of at-Tirmidhi from Abi dzarr) In this verse there are two kinds of attributes of Allah SWT which are mentioned at once, namely \"The Most Recipient of Repentance\", and \"The Most Merciful\".

Second, the path that will lead people to loss and misery in this world and in the hereafter, namely the path of disbelievers and those who are disobedient towards Him, and follow Satan's enticements.

If they convert to Islam then that will be a strong reason that can be directed at Christians and other infidels who do not want to believe, because it is the Jewish people who first promised Allah that they will believe in every prophet sent by them. Yes, if there is real evidence. Israel is the title given to the Prophet Jacob. Because of that his descendants were called the Children of Israel. Prophet Jacob is known as a servant of God who is very pious, patient, and trustful. So Allah calls Jacob's descendants at the beginning of this verse as \"Children of Israel\" to remind them that they should follow the example of their ancestors in terms of faith, obedience, piety, piety and patience as well as other commendable qualities. This was because at the time the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, there were signs that the behavior of the Children of Israel had crossed the line, and had deviated far from the teachings and characteristics of their forefathers, especially their attitude towards Al- The Qur'an revealed by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. They do not want to believe that the Qur'an is a revelation from Allah, they even deny the prophethood and apostleship of Muhammad saw. They should have been the first to believe in the Prophet Muhammad, because the news about his arrival had been mentioned earlier in their holy book, namely the Torah. In this verse there are three kinds of Allah's commandments to the Children of Israel, namely: 1. So that they always remember the favors Allah has bestowed upon them, and give thanks for them with words and deeds. The form of these blessings is not explained in this verse. But what is meant, among other things, is that Allah has chosen His prophets from among them. This happened for quite a long time, so they were given the nickname Sya'bullah al-Mukhtar, namely \"God's chosen servants\". All that they should remember and they are grateful. One way to be grateful is to have faith in every prophet sent by God to provide guidance to humans. But in reality they used this blessing as an excuse not to accept the call of the Prophet Muhammad, instead ridiculing him, and saying that Allah's favors and bounties were only certain for them. 2. Their promises to Allah are of two kinds. The first is a promise that applies to all human beings, namely that they must weigh all problems with the scales of reason and thought and investigation that will lead them to know the essence of everything, as a way to know Allah. Second, the promise that they will only worship Allah alone, and will not associate Him with anything; and that they will believe in His messengers. If the Children of Israel who existed at that time paid attention to these promises, among other things, that Allah would send a prophet from the descendants of their forefathers who sent down a new nation, namely the Arab nation, they would have believed in the Prophet Muhammad. and surely they also follow the instructions that Allah revealed to him. Thus they will be among those who gain victory. On the other hand, if they fulfill their promise to Allah, then Allah will allow them to settle in the holy land of Palestine, and they will be given glory and a prosperous life. The fact shows that they did not fulfill their promises, partly because they were afraid and worried about one another. 3. So that they only fear Allah. This command was given by Allah, because the facts show that the Children of Israel did not fulfill their promises to Allah, among other things, they did not want to believe in the Prophet Muhammad. This is because of their fear of each other. So Allah ordered them to fear Allah alone, and do not fear anyone other than Allah. Because, only Allah is the master of all matters. It is He who has given them such great favors, He is also the one who has the power to revoke the favors from their hands, and He is also the one who will punish them for not being grateful for the favors. They should not fear their neighbor for fear of the loss of some of their advantages, or of calamity for themselves by following the right and violating the will of their leaders. God is more powerful than those leaders."

Commands brought by the Al-Qur'an, among others: the command to do da'wah, to leave abominable deeds, whether visible or not, orders to do good, prohibition of doing what is wrong, and believe in the existence of the hereafter, as judgment Day. This is the same as what the Prophet Musa (as) had called on them, and also by previous prophets, namely: strengthening the right, providing guidance to all creatures and eradicating the error that has polluted the true faith. 2. So that they do not hastily deny the Qur'an so that they are the first to deny it, even though they should be the first to believe in it, because they already know about it, because it has been reported in the holy book they. 3. So that they do not sell the verses of Allah at a small price. That is: so that they do not turn away from the instructions of the Al-Qur'an to pursue small profits, in the form of wealth or rank. The expected benefits are very small, because then they will not gain the pleasure of Allah, on the contrary, they will be overwritten by His punishment in this world and in the hereafter. 4. So that they fear only Allah, namely by believing in Him and following what is right, and leaving worldly pleasures if it turns out that worldly delights hinder actions and work to achieve happiness in the afterlife."

That is, the leaders of the Children of Israel like to enter personal opinions into the Torah, so that it is difficult to distinguish which one is correct. Especially in their refusal to believe in the Prophet Muhammad, they make up excuses to vilify him, and misinterpret the words of their forefathers, so that they stick to the words of their leaders and traditions, instead of accepting the teachings brought by the Prophet Muhammad. saw. Even though the order is addressed to the Children of Israel, its contents can also be addressed to Muslims from all walks of life, especially leaders and people in power, so that this verse seems to say, \"O you people in power, do not mix up justice and tyranny, O judges, don't mix law and bribery; O officials, don't mix duty and corruption; O scholars, don't mix knowledge and wealth, and so on.\" ) 2. So they don't hide the truth, even though they know it. Meaning: The Children of Israel have hidden the truth that they already know from their holy book. Among other things, is the news from Allah about the Prophet Muhammad who will be sent as the seal of all Allah's messengers for all mankind. They deliberately hide this from the general public, they even try to disgrace the Prophet Muhammad, to prevent people from believing in him. This verse denounces such acts of those of them, and anyone who willfully hides something that is true. After Allah conveyed an appeal to them to believe in the Qur'an, then in the following verse Allah ordered them to always carry out what has been determined by the Shari'a, especially performing prayers, paying zakat, and submitting and obeying Allah's commands. ."

So that they pay zakat, because zakat is an expression of gratitude to Allah for the blessings He has bestowed, and fosters close relationships among human beings, and purifies the heart, because zakat is a sacrifice of property to help the poor, and with zakat it can also be done cooperation and mutual assistance in society, where the poor need help from the rich and vice versa, the rich need the help of people who are rich. poor. In this connection Rasulullah saw. has said: \"A believer to another believer is like a building, each part of which strengthens the other.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 3. So that they bow down with those who bow down. The intention is for them to convert to Islam and perform congregational prayers like the Muslims. In this connection the Prophet has said: \"Praying in congregation is more important with twenty-seven degrees than praying alone\". (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) We already know that prayer according to Islam consists of various physical movements, such as bowing, prostration, iktidal, and so on. But at the end of this verse, the prayer is only expressed by the words \"bowing\". This is meant to emphasize that they should pray properly as required by Islamic law as taught by the Prophet Muhammad, not to pray according to their former way, namely praying without bowing."

			"tafsir": "The background of this verse, according to Ibn 'Abbas, is that among the Jews in Medina there were those who advised their families and close relatives who had converted to Islam to keep embracing Islam. What this person was ordered to do was right, that is, they told others to do what was right but they themselves did not practice it. So in this verse Allah denounces their behavior and deeds that are not good and lead them astray. Among the errors that have been committed by the Jewish people is that they claim to have faith in their holy book, namely the Torah, but it turns out that they did not read it properly. In this verse it is said that they \"forgot\" themselves. The point is \"allowing\" themselves to lose, because usually humans never forget themselves to gain profit, and they are not willing if other people get ahead of them to get happiness. The expression \"forgetting\" shows how they neglect and do not care about what they should do, as if Allah said, \"If you truly believe in Allah that He will reward you for good deeds, and threaten to punish people who abandoned those good deeds, why have you forgotten your own interests?\" It is quite clear that this sentence contains unparalleled reproach, because whoever orders someone else to do a good deed but doesn't do it himself means he has violated his own words. The priests who always read the scriptures to others, of course, know more about the contents of the book than the people they ask them to follow. There is a huge difference between a person who performs an action even though he does not really know the benefits of that action, and a person who abandons that action even though he really knows the benefits of the action he left behind. Therefore, Allah sees that they are as if they are unreasonable, because intelligent people, no matter how weak, will certainly practice their knowledge. This Word of God, although addressed to the Children of Israel, is also a lesson for others. Every nation, both individually and as a whole, should pay attention to its own situation, and try to distance itself from the conditions and characteristics that exist in the Jewish nation which is criticized in the verse above, so as not to meet the consequences they experienced."

			"tafsir": "After explaining how bad the conditions and characteristics of the Children of Israel were, so that their minds were of no use to them and the scriptures in their hands did not bring any benefit to them, Allah guided them to the best path, namely so that they seek help from Allah with patience and prayer. What is meant by \"patience\" here is the attitude and behavior as follows: 1. Be steadfast in facing the reality that is happening, don't panic, but still be able to control your emotions. 2. Calmly accept the fact and think about why it happened, why it happened and how to best deal with it. 3. Calmly and calculatingly and trustfully make improvements by avoiding the causes of failure and making more precise anticipations based on experience. Being patient means following Allah's commandments and keeping away from His prohibitions, by curbing lust and passions from all forbidden actions. Performing prayers can prevent us from doing bad deeds, and by praying we always remember Allah, so that it will prevent us from doing bad things, whether other people know about it or not. Salat is a very important worship where we can pray to Allah five times every day. \"Rasulullah SAW, when facing a serious problem, he prays\". (Ahmad's history). Performing prayers is felt heavy and difficult, except by people who are solemn, namely people who truly believe in and obey Allah, and carry out His commands sincerely because they hope for His pleasure alone, and protect themselves from His punishment. . For people who are solemn, carrying out prayers is not felt to be heavy, because at those moments they are diligent and immersed in praying to Allah so that they no longer feel and remember anything else, either in the form of difficulties or suffering that they experienced before. Regarding this, Rasulullah saw said: \"And made my heart calm in prayer\" (History of Ahmad and an-Nasa'i). In addition, they are eagerly waiting for a reward from Allah for the worship so that various difficulties in carrying it out can be overcome easily. This is not surprising, because a person who knows the nature of what he is looking for is undoubtedly easy for him to sacrifice anything to get it. People who believe that Allah will give a greater compensation than what he has given, surely he will feel light in giving to others what he has."

			"tafsir": "Allah has excelled the Children of Israel from other nations who at that time had high civilization and culture, for example the Egyptians and the inhabitants of the holy land of Palestine. Allah again calls them at the beginning of this verse by mentioning the name of their ancestor \"Israel\", namely the Prophet Jacob as because he is the origin of their nationality, and the source of their glory. The favors that have been bestowed on him can be enjoyed by all of them. The advantages that God had bestowed upon them before were because their ancestors held fast to noble qualities, and avoided bad traits and deeds, because every person who was noble and prioritized over other people certainly wanted to maintain their honor. that, so that he stays away from despicable qualities and deeds. The Israelites who existed at the time of the revelation of this verse had far deviated from the noble qualities upheld by their ancestors. Therefore, Allah warns them about the favors and virtues that have been given to make them aware that Allah, who has given them advantages, certainly has the right to give them to other people, for example, to the Prophet Muhammad and his people. The Children of Israel should pay more attention to the verses revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Someone who is given an advantage should first do priority than others. If the priority given to the Children of Israel is due to the fact that many prophets were chosen from among them, then this does not guarantee that each individual from the Children of Israel is superior to those outside their environment. There is even the possibility that others are more noble than them when they themselves have left the traditions and teachings of their prophets. While other people make it the best guide and guideline for their lives. If their priority is due to their closeness to Allah, even they once considered themselves as sya'bullah al-mukhtar, because they used to follow His Shari'a, then this only applies to the Prophets along with those who carry out the Shari'a. without deviating from these teachings, and still walking on the right path, so that they are entitled to receive these advantages and virtues. But those who have abandoned the teachings of the prophets can certainly no longer be seen as \"those close\" to God."

In this way they can protect themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, which no one will be able to stop, no one can save themselves from it except those who believe and fear Allah and follow the Shari'a and Allah's instructions. Allah swt explains that on the Day of Judgment no one can provide help to other people to be free from His punishment, and everyone is responsible for their own actions. A person cannot take on the sins of another person, even if he wants to. This is God's firmness over the untruth of their assumption that based on the virtues that are in them, they will get intercession. Even though this assumption is not true, because it is the believers who will receive intercession from Allah. Intercession is the help given by the messenger or certain people to relieve someone's punishment or burden in the afterlife, with Allah's permission. In this connection Allah swt says: And one person will not bear the burden of other people's sins. (al-An'am\/6:164) And if someone who is burdened with the weight of his sins calls (another person) to carry his burden, nothing will be carried for him, even if (who he calls is) his relatives. (Fatir\/35:18) On that day a man flees from his brothers, and from his mother and father, and from his wife and children. Every one of them that day had some business to occupy him with. ('Abasa\/80:34-37) Although this warning is addressed to the Children of Israel, it also applies to Muslims, so that while living in the world they try to prepare themselves as well as possible, so that later on the Day of Resurrection they will be spared from Allah's punishment. The way is to follow Allah's instructions and carry out His rules."

The first person from among the Children of Israel who entered Egypt was the Prophet Yusuf. Then his brothers also came there and lived with him. Furthermore, they multiplied there, so that within a period of + 400 years (from the time of Prophet Yusuf to Prophet Musa) their number has reached hundreds of thousands of people. The natives are increasingly under pressure, because the Children of Israel are hard at work and have smarter minds. In addition, they are very selfish, because they still think of themselves as sya'bullah al-mukhtar. Because of this, they don't want to unite with the natives, and don't want to cooperate and help them in their daily lives. Seeing this situation, the indigenous people of the country are increasingly worried, because if the Israelites increase in number, they will dominate the situation and the native population will be increasingly pressured. Therefore, they tried to weaken the power of the Children of Israel. At first by forcing them to do forced labor. Then it escalated further with the killing of their sons, and only their daughters who were spared. About this event compare Exodus i.16 ; Pharaoh ordered the midwives. The torture and suffering of the Children of Israel is described in Exodus 1.22, and several other places in the Old Testament. Pharaoh ordered every tribe of his people to kill every male child of the Children of Israel, even their little children. The suffering that the Children of Israel experienced was a test for them because they had forgotten His blessings and had committed various sins. Then Allah swt forgave and accepted their repentance, and He also bestowed great favors, namely being saved from the misery they experienced from Pharaoh's cruelty. But this grace is also a test for them, whether they will be grateful for the blessing, or not. Muslims can take a very valuable lesson from the story of the Children of Israel. Allah swt, initially bestowed His various blessings on the Muslim community, so that the people were united under the banner of Islam and lived in strong brotherhood, and succeeded in building a strong Islamic state. But then there was a split among the Muslims, so that Allah swt brought disaster upon them. The Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad was overthrown by the Tartars. Then came the Crusades which lasted about 200 years. Meanwhile, western nations infiltrated Islamic countries, controlled their sources of wealth so that Muslims everywhere became weak."

			"tafsir": "In this verse it is mentioned that another blessing was given to the Children of Israel, that is, Allah saved them when they left Egypt under the leadership of the Prophet Musa as from the pursuit of Pharaoh and his army. After Allah made Musa an Apostle, He ordered that Pharaoh and his people call on Pharaoh and his people to believe in Him, demanded that Pharaoh free the Children of Israel who were in the land, and stop the atrocities being committed against them. In response, Pharaoh intensified his torture and cruelty towards the Children of Israel and ordered his people to increase the forced labor they were subjected to. Then Allah gave various miracles to Musa as and his brother, Prophet Harun, including the staff of Prophet Musa which could turn into a snake and could swallow snakes incarnated by magicians who were deployed by Pharaoh to fight the miracles of Prophet Musa as. Seeing this fact, the magicians also admit their defeat, then declare their faith in God. Finally Pharaoh chased them away. So they left the country under the leadership of the Prophet Musa, while Pharaoh and his army chased them. When they reached the shores of the Red Sea which borders the city of Suez with the Sinai Peninsula, Allah ordered Prophet Musa to strike his staff into the sea. Then Musa (as) did it. Then the sea water split open and spread out twelve highway lanes that would be traversed by Prophet Musa as with his followers consisting of twelve groups, so that they safely reached the other side. Meanwhile Pharaoh and his entourage continued to chase them. But when they arrived in the middle of the sea, the sea water joined again, so that they all drowned in the sea water. The incident was witnessed by the Children of Israel who had survived to the other side. The parting of the sea is one of the various miracles of Prophet Musa (as) to prove to people that Allah is Almighty. It is He who created this world and He also establishes natural laws that apply for all time, and He also has the power to change or cancel these natural laws if He wills. The natural law that applies to water is that water as a liquid cannot be separated without another object separating it. It was this law that He changed and annulled when the waters of the sea parted. The sea water was separated and stood like perpendicular walls without anything to hold it, so that a path was laid out between the walls. Such is the magnitude of the blessings that Allah has bestowed on the Children of Israel. They have been freed from the cruelty of Pharaoh and his people. Then they were also saved when they crossed the sea. After that they witnessed with their own eyes the sinking of their enemies in the middle of the sea which of course made them happy. They should be grateful for these blessings."

It would be nice if you kept the promise you made, and you followed my Shari'a.) Therefore, repent to your Lord who created you, and do not do such stupidity, where you have left your true God, then you take a calf as your idol.\" Musa as also ordered them, \"Kill yourselves.\" That is, so that those who have not committed a crime among them kill those who have been guilty of it, or those who have committed a crime kill each other, or they are ordered to kill themselves as a statement of repentance to Allah. In the Old Testament Book of Exodus xxxii.27-28 it is stated that 3,000 people died as a result of the murder. Then Musa (as) told them that repenting and killing themselves as a statement of repentance is better for them in the sight of Allah than continuing to commit disobedience which causes them to be punished. If they are clean from that sin, then they deserve to receive rewards and rewards. Abdullah Yusuf Ali argues \"kill your lust\"; anfusakum in this verse means lust, not personality. Almost in line with the opinion of al-Qasimi, Muhammad Asad, and others. At the end of this verse Allah explains that after they did what Moses commanded, Allah accepted their repentance and forgave their mistakes, because it was He who made way for those sinners to repent, and He accepted their repentance.

This happened when they left Egypt, and crossed the Red Sea. They came to the desert and was hit by a very, very scorching heat. Then they complained to Prophet Musa. As soon as he prayed to Allah, asking for help for them, Allah sent a dark cloud to overshadow them, so that they could walk all the way to the land they were going to. Besides that, Allah also gave them food, namely food called mann which is sweet like honey, which descends continuously from dawn to sunset, as well as another food ingredient called salwa, which is a kind of quail. Each of them took enough to eat until the next day. Facing the very hot air temperature in the middle of the desert, people are easily drained of their energy and energy. Therefore, as a substitute for lost energy, food and drinks that contain lots of sugar are needed. Mann is a kind of sweet food or energy drink like honey which is much needed in desert areas. If someone eats foods that contain lots of sugar besides increasing energy and giving the effect of feeling happy, it also makes people more excited. In addition to foods with high sugar content, meat is also needed which contains protein and fat. Salwa is a type of quail whose meat has a very high protein and fat content, this food is needed by people in the hot desert. Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise by giving Mann and Salwa food to the Children of Israel who made the long and arduous journey from Egypt to Syria. Allah commands them to eat good food, from the sustenance He has bestowed. Good food is food that is lawful and beneficial for health and growth of the body. This shows that whatever Allah commands people to benefit from, it is for themselves, not for Him. Rather, whatever He forbids people to shun, it is all to save them themselves from the calamity that will befall them because of that deed. A natural product chemist from Belgium, Dr. Errera (1893) suspected that manna was a lower plant species, which included 'lichens' from the class of unattached lichens (lichens that are not attached, easily detached). After making observations, Errera suspected that the manna was very likely a species of lichen known by its scientific name: Aspicilia esculenta. This Aspicilia esculenta lichen is very easily carried away by wind or storms, so it looks as if it was lowered (anzalnaa, lowered) from the sky. This lichen has a high nutritional content and also contains antibiotic substances (thayyib, good food). As for salwa, it is most likely quail. It is understandable that the Children of Israel were able to survive for a long time (about 40 years) in the wilderness of Sinai, because they received grace from Allah SWT, in the form of manna, which is a source of carbohydrates with high nutrition and also contains antibiotics. As for the source of protein obtained from salwa. Wallahu a'lam bis-sawab."

The Children of Israel then asked Musa (as) to pray to God that He would bring out the vegetables that the earth grows in exchange for mann and salwa. They didn't want to pray alone, but hoped that Moses would pray to God, because they saw Moses as a person close to God and besides he was a prophet who could give thanks to God. The vegetables and other things they asked for were abundant in the cities, but not in the desert. Actually the request is not difficult to find, because they can get it if they go to town. Prophet Musa refused the request with great disappointment and annoyance and criticized their attitude because they refused mann and salwa, foods that actually contain high nutritional value and are much needed by the body, replaced with vegetables that are lower in nutrition. Then Prophet Musa told them to get out of the Sinai desert and go towards the city. There they will get what they want, because the Sinai desert where they lived until the time appointed by God, could not grow vegetables. They stayed in the Sinai desert because they were weak and could not stand to defeat the inhabitants of the land that was promised to them. They will be released from things they don't like, if they have the courage to fight those around them, namely the inhabitants of the earth that Allah promised and guaranteed to give them help. Therefore, they should find a way to get victory and profit. After Allah told about Moses' rejection of their request and beforehand also spread all the blessings bestowed upon them, in this verse Allah sets out some of the crimes of the descendants of the Children of Israel that came later, namely they denied Allah's verses, killed the prophets and their violation of God's law. Therefore, Allah inflicted on them humiliation and poverty as a form of His wrath. They should have received Divine wrath, endured the calamities and torments in this world and the painful doom in the hereafter. Likewise they get humiliation and poverty because they always reject the verses of Allah that have been given to the Prophet Musa in the form of miracles that they have witnessed themselves. Their rebellion and rejection of Prophet Musa is a proof that Allah's verses have no effect on their souls. They still deny it. They killed the prophets from their group, without any good reason. Indeed, people who make mistakes sometimes believe that what they do is right. Their actions in this way are not due to a wrong understanding or interpretation of the law, but indeed they deliberately violate God's laws which have been prescribed in their religion. Their disbelief towards Allah's verses and their impudence killed the prophets, because they transgressed many of the provisions of their religion. Religion should have a great influence on the human soul, so that its adherents are afraid of disobeying God's commands. If someone goes beyond the rules or boundaries of his religion, it means that the influence of religion on his soul is weak. The more often he violates the limits of religious law, the weaker the influence of religion on his soul. Until finally the violation of religious provisions became his habit, as if he had forgotten the existence of religious boundaries and regulations. Finally, the influence of religion disappeared in his heart."

Jews are all people who embrace Judaism. They are called Jews because most of them are of Jewish descent, one of the descendants of Jacob (Israil). Christians are people who adhere to the Christian religion. The word Christian is taken from the name of the Nasirah (Nazareth) area in Palestine, where the Prophet Isa was born.

Apparently they do not practice it, even deny it. Then God lifted the hill (Mount Sinai) above their heads to show His power so that they would believe in Him and hold fast to the Torah. The contents of the agreement were in the form of God's command to them, \"Hold the Torah seriously and keep working on its contents, study the Torah, pay attention to its contents and practice the laws contained therein.\" This verse gives an understanding that those who abandon the Shari'a and belittle God's law are equated with those who deny and oppose it. So it is fitting for him to be gathered in a state of blindness on the Day of Resurrection. He cannot see the way of victory and the way of happiness. He said, \"O my Lord, why did you gather me blind, when before I could see?\" He (Allah) said, \"Thus, our verses came to you before, and you ignored them, so (also) today you are ignored.\" (tah\/20: 125 and 126) If someone denies Allah's Shari'a and neglects His law, it means that Shari'a has no effect whatsoever on his soul. In connection with the understanding of this verse it can be said that people who only read the Qur'an without putting its contents into practice do not benefit from the contents of the Qur'an. The purpose of following the holy books is to practice their contents, not just to read them and sing all kinds of melodious songs. Then Allah ordered the Children of Israel to stick to the Torah, always study it, and practice its contents so that they would become pious people."

			"tafsir": "In the provisions of the Jewish religious law, on the seventh day, the Sabbath (from the Hebrew, shabbath, meaning \"rest\") people are prohibited from doing anything, because that day is specifically for worship. In Arabic sabt (Saturday), from the word sabata, yasbitu, sabtan, also means \"rest\" or \"calm.\" On that day after \"the heavens and the earth and all that is in them are completed\" God rested. \"Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it\" (Genesis ii. 1-3), which is also used to celebrate the release of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. According to the Old Testament, those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath, including fishing on that day, were subject to the death penalty: \"Anyone who violates the sanctity of the Sabbath shall surely be put to death, for anyone who does any work on that day must be cut off from among the nation\". (Book of Exodus 31. 14). On that very respected day, fish usually appear freely so that they cover the surface of the sea water, because that day no one dares to disturb it. Outside of Saturday the fish disappeared again (al-A'raf\/7: 163). Many commentators say that they have circumvented this prohibition; on the days before the Sabbath they made a large pool and threw seawater into it. On Sunday they work to take the fish that have been netted. But in God's law they still violate, so God punishes them by making them monkeys, so they are far from virtue and despicable and lowly. According to Mujahid, as narrated by Ibn Jarir, \"They were not changed physically to become monkeys, but their hearts, souls and characteristics were made like monkeys, so they could not receive teachings and could not understand threats.\" In this verse they are likened to monkeys and in another verse they are likened to donkeys, according to the word of Allah: The parable of those who are given the task of carrying the Torah, then they do not carry it (do not practice it) is like a donkey carrying thick books ... In another tradition it is stated that those who were turned into monkeys had no children, did not eat, did not drink, and could not live more than three days. In the Qur'an there are verses that are similar in meaning: ¦ And among them (there are) those who are made into monkeys and pigs and (those who) worship Tagut.\"¦(al-Ma'idah\/5:60)"

In a hadith it is stated, \"If they immediately slaughtered a cow when they received the order, that would be enough.

Done, without having to ask too many questions. But they are used to being chatty and asking all kinds of questions about the cow \"with the intention of mocking\" even though the questions are clear. Because they are stubborn, the consequences make it difficult for themselves, as described in verse 71 and emphasized in the hadith above.

The verses above (67-71) are one unit. The event is closely related to verse 72 below. According to the Jewish tradition in the law of Musa (as), if there is a murder where it is not known who killed it, the elders and judges must go out to measure the distance to the cities around the person killed; they must take a heifer that has never been used to plow; they must break the ox's neck in a valley; all the elders of the nearest town shall wash their hands over the heifer that had its neck broken in the valley, and they shall declare, that their hands have not shed blood and their eyes have not seen it; then peace was held and they asked him not to shed blood on innocent people (Book of Deuteronomy xxi. 1-9)."

			"tafsir": "This verse reveals the character of the Jewish people. After they were guided to the right path and also understood the truth, their hearts became hardened even more. Allah likened the hearts of the Jews to stones which in geological terms is used to refer to all kinds of objects that are species of coral, or material like coral that is hard, to show the hardness of their hearts to accept God's guidance. Maybe even harder. Even though the stone is hard, at some point and for some reason it can split or crack. From the cracked rock, water gushed out, and then gathered into tributaries. Sometimes the stones fell from the mountains because they were obedient to the power of Allah. Thus the heart of the Jews is harder than stone, as if it does not know the slightest crack. Their hearts are not swayed by religious teachings or advice that normally penetrates the human heart. However, there is a heart that is filled with faith, and that heart changes from being hard to being soft because of the fear of Allah. This is often seen in everyday life. The heart that used to be rebellious against religion eventually becomes soft, people who usually commit immorality become obedient thanks to God's guidance. And indeed among the People of the Book there are those who believe in Allah, and in what has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to them, because they are humble to Allah, and they do not buy and sell Allah's verses cheaply. They will be rewarded with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is very fast in His calculations. (Ali 'Imran\/3:199) Likewise in another verse, Allah says: And among the Bedouin Arabs, there are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and see what they spend (in the way of Allah) as a way to bring closer to Allah and as a way to (obtain) the Apostle's prayer. (at-Taubah\/9:99) According to scientists, the word \"heart\" does not refer to the liver (liver), but generally refers to the heart. The heart is an internal organ, located in the chest and the size of a fist. The heart is divided into two sides, namely the right side and the left side. Each side is further divided into two chambers, namely the upper chamber (atrium) and lower chamber (ventricle). The chambers pulse as much as 70 times per minute to keep blood flowing throughout the body. When calculated, the heart will beat more than 30 million times a year. The journey of blood, when measured and starting from the lungs and heart, will flow through the blood vessels throughout the body along 96,000 km. The distance is covered in 23 seconds each round. It can be seen how important the role of the heart is in human life. The word heart in Arabic is 'qalb. The word is also used for another purpose, namely to mean feelings or heart. The heart, like the heart, is also very important in life. The Prophet Muhammad saw, after exemplifying many things about good and bad, said about the heart in the sense of the center of feeling or the center of sensitivity, thus: \"... In fact, in man there is a lump of flesh as big as chewing, if it is good, the whole body will be fine and if damaged, the whole body is damaged. It is the heart.\" (Al-Bukhari's history through Nu'man bin Basyir) The heart or heart is often accompanied by \"heart\". Often put together and be careful. There are several verses related to the heart and sensitivity, two of which are Surah al-Isra'\/17: and Qaf\/50: 37 which means the following: \"And We made their hearts closed and their ears blocked, so that they could not understand it. And if you mention only your Lord in the Koran, they turn back and run away (because of hatred).\" (al-Isra'\/17: 46) \"Indeed, in that there must be a warning for those who have a heart or who uses hearing, while he doubts it.\" (Qaf\/50: 37) In the language of the Qur'an, it is stated that a closed heart will make its owner unable to accept the truth let alone follow it. He can only follow things that are not in line with the right, namely lust. The closure of the heart that God does is as a result of their own actions. They are reluctant to use their hearing, sight and heart, so that in the end their hearts are corroded and closed. Traditionally, people assume that communication between the head\/brain (mind) and heart\/heart (feelings) takes place in one direction, namely how the heart reacts to what the brain commands. However, it is now revealed that the communication between the heart and the brain takes place very dynamically, continuously, in two directions, and each of these organs influences their function one another. A study revealed that the heart communicates to the brain in four ways, namely (1) transmission through nerves, (2) biochemically through hormones and nerve transmitters, (3) biophysically through pressure waves, and (4) energetically through wave interactions. electromagnetic. All forms of communication result in activity in the brain. Research reveals that the messages the heart conveys to the brain will influence behavior. So far, experts believe that the heart's electromagnetic field is the most powerful field that humans have. This field not only affects every cell in his body, but also covers all directions in the surrounding space. It is suspected that the electromagnetic field is a very important information carrier. It can even be proven that one person's electromagnetic field can affect the workings of other people's brains."

			"tafsir": "Allah reminded the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, when He decreed for the Children of Israel the promise they had to fulfill, namely that they would not worship anything other than Allah. Allah forbade them to worship other than Allah, even in the form of humans or idols and other things, because that means associating partners with Allah with these objects. Worshiping other than Allah is sometimes done with other actions that glorify something that is being worshiped. The religion of Allah brought by His messengers emphasizes worshiping Allah, the One and only and not associating Him with anything, as Allah says: And worship Allah and do not associate Him with anything…. (an-Nisa'\/4:36) This promise from the Children of Israel begins with a promise to fulfill Allah's rights, the highest and greatest right, that is, only He has the right to be worshiped, no one has anything to associate with Him. All creatures are commanded to worship Him and it is for this task that they were actually created. After mentioning Allah's right, it is followed by an order to do good to parents, a highest good deed. Because it was through both parents that God created man. Allah says: ¦And do good to both parents, ... (an-Nisa'\/4:36) Doing good to parents is by loving, nurturing and guarding them perfectly and obeying their wishes as long as they do not violate God's commands. As for the wisdom of being filial to mothers and fathers, it is because these parents have sacrificed for the benefit of their children when they were small with full attention and compassion. They educate him and take care of all the interests of his child when he is still weak, has not been able to take advantage of anything and has not been able to avoid danger. Apart from that, parents provide unparalleled love. Is it not obligatory for children to give recompense to their parents as a reward for their kindness? There is no reward for kindness other than kindness (too). (ar-Rahman\/55:60) The love of both parents for their children is due to: 1. The love that Allah bestowed on them to perfect His favors for the maintenance of human kind. 2. Gratitude towards his children. 3. Hope for the future of their children to be able to help them both with wealth and with energy in life. 4. Can continue the mission of both parents. After Allah mentions the rights of both parents, he also mentions the rights of relatives (family), that is, to do good to them, because doing good to close relatives is a factor that strengthens the ties of brotherhood among these relatives. An ummah consists of families and households. So the good and bad of the people depend on the good and bad of the family and household. People who don't build a household means they don't take part in fostering the community element. Then each household should connect kinship ties with other households based on heredity, religion or nationality. Thus a strong nation and people will be built. Having close relationships among family members is in accordance with human nature. The religion of Islam, the religion of nature provides a good way for the growth of this kinship bond. Then Allah also mentions the rights of those who need help, namely the rights of the poor. Doing good to orphans is educating them well and maintaining all their rights. Al-Qur'an and Sunnah strongly recommend paying attention to orphans even though they are rich, because what is seen is their orphanhood. They have lost the person they are complaining to. Allah bequeathed orphans to the community to regard them as their own children, to provide education. If they are neglected, they can cause damage to other children, and the consequences will be bigger for the nation and state. Doing kindness to the poor is to provide assistance to them, especially when they are hit by difficulties. The Prophet said: People who help widows and poor people, are like people who strive in the way of Allah. (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah). Allah gives priority to mentioning orphans rather than poor people because the poor can try to find food for themselves, while orphans, because they are still young, are not yet able to try on their own. After receiving an order to do good to parents, families, orphans and poor people, then the order is to say good words to fellow human beings. When the virtue has been done, it means that the height and progress of society has been achieved. Allah then ordered the Children of Israel to carry out the prayers and zakat as outlined by Allah for them. Prayers in every religion aim to improve the soul, cleanse it from humility and adorn the soul with all kinds of virtues. The spirit of prayer is sincere to Allah, submission to His greatness and power. If the prayer is empty of the spirit, it will not give any benefit. The Children of Israel have always ignored the spirit of prayer since ancient times until the time the Qur'an was revealed and even up to now. Zakat is also ordered to them, because zakat contains benefits for society. The Jews used to have several kinds of zakat obligations. But the Children of Israel turned away from these orders, did not carry them out, and even avoided them. This includes their deviations, namely regarding their priests as God who establishes halal and haram laws, adds religious ceremonies according to their wishes, leaves maintenance for relatives, neglects zakat, does not do good and forbid evil and other acts that undermine religion. Only a small part of them at the time of Musa (as) or at any age obeyed Allah's commands. In every era, in every nation or people, there are always groups of people who are willing to fight for the truth according to their beliefs and abilities. However, when evil has spread to the people, the presence of sincere people does not prevent Allah's punishment from descending. At the end of this verse Allah says, \"And you (O Children of Israel) always turn away.\" This verse shows their habit and preference for disobeying Divine instructions and orders, so that evil is spread and punishment falls on them."

They should be a united nation because of one religion and one lineage. Each one should feel that he and his blood are himself and the blood of his people. This verse also contains a prohibition on committing crimes punishable by death (qisas), or expulsion from one's hometown which means \"kill oneself\". If you do something wrong that can be sentenced to death, it means killing yourself.

			"tafsir": "This verse mentions the reality of the Jews' violation of God's prohibition. In Medina since before the Prophet Muhammad there were three Jewish tribes namely Bani Qainuqa, Bani Nadir, Bani Quraizah. The three tribes were involved in a civil war that broke out between the Aus and Khazraj tribes; both are natives of the city of Medina. Bani Qainuqa and Bani Nadir were allies of the Khazraj tribe, while Bani Quraizah were allies of the Aws tribe. Thus there was war and expulsion between fellow Jews themselves. This verse explains that after receiving this strong promise, they broke it by killing their own brothers and sisters, they killed each other as people had done to them, while they confessed that God's promise also applies to them. Some Jews helped the Arabs who had become their allies by committing sins such as murder and war, and assisted them in hostilities such as expulsion from their homeland. If someone was taken prisoner, whether an Arab or a Jew who was hostile, they demanded a ransom to release him. Each group of Jews redeemed their people who were captives, even though the captives were their enemies. They argued that their holy book commanded them to ransom the captives of this holy nation. If they truly believe in their book as they say, why do they expel their brothers and sisters from their village, when the Torah forbids them to do so? If so, isn't that making fun of religion? Why do they believe in some books and deny others? Allah has made a promise with the Children of Israel in the Torah, not to kill one another and expel one another. In the Torah it is stated, \"Whoever male or female servant from the Children of Israel you find, pay the price and set him free.\" But they still kill each other among themselves and still repel each other. They broke their promise to Allah. If anyone was taken prisoner, they ransomed it, in obedience to their promise. This shows that they believe in some of the contents of the Book and do not believe in other parts. Retaliation for violators of the provisions above is destruction in this world and a painful punishment in the hereafter. The facts have shown that people who act dishonestly against God's commands and throw religion backwards, they will be divided and will be subject to the punishment of humiliation as revenge for their moral decay and crimes. As for those who remain righteous, purify themselves and are in good condition, they will receive favor with their Lord. Allah is never unaware of what they do. He will repay all human deeds."

They, with the arrival of the long-awaited book, actually hoped for victory over the Arab polytheists and the Meccan infidels. This can be seen from their words that the long-awaited book will support the monotheism brought by Musa as, to subdue the wasaniyah religion embraced by the Arabs. Narrated by Ibn Jarir from Qatadah al-Ansari from parents from among the Ansar they said, \"The story mentioned in this verse is about us and the Jews of Medina. We used to practice their religion during the Jahiliyya period, while at that time we are still polytheists and they are people of the book. They say that a prophet who will be sent is near, we will follow him. Together with that prophet we will destroy you as Allah destroyed the people of 'Ad and Iram. But after Rasulullah SAW was sent, we followed him , while the Jews denied it.\" From this story it can be understood that they are actually envious of the Muslims, this envy arose after Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad, from among the Arabs, not from among them.

They allege that Prophet Sulayman collected the magic books, and kept them under his throne, then took them out and broadcast them. Allegations like this are a forgery and an act influenced by lust. In fact, they only linked the magic to Prophet Sulaiman. Prophet Sulaiman did not teach or practice magic because he knew that such an act would include denying God, especially when viewed from his position as a prophet, it was impossible for him to practice magic. Stories about magic are told in the Qur'an, especially in the story of Musa and Pharaoh. In that story, the properties of magic are explained, that magic is a sleight of hand that deceives the eye, so that those who see it think that what is seen is as if it were the real situation. This is explained in the word of God: \"¦He (Moses) imagined as if snakes were crawling fast, because of their magic¦. (taha\/20:66) And according to the word of God: \"¦They bewitched the eyes of the people and made the people it's fear,¦ (al-A'raf\/7:116) Magic is something hidden, which only some humans know. But what has happened shows that the two angels are incapable of exerting supernatural influence beyond human capabilities, in fact what they call magical power is only skill in mastering causes that have something to do with the effects that are carried out. This only happens because of Allah's permission solely, in accordance with the law that has been established by Him. In practice, the sorcerers cast spells by mentioning the names of demons and the kings of the jinn so that it appears as if the spell was granted by the king of the jinn. It is on the basis of their practice that there is a widespread opinion among members of society that witchcraft is assisted by the devil. Then the Jews who were contemporaries of the Prophet Muhammad spread this magic among Muslims with the aim of misleading. They got the magic from their ancestors who said the magic was from Solomon as. Even though the two angels did not teach magic to anyone, before giving advice so that people do not practice magic, because people who practice magic are infidels. Verse 102 is inseparable from the previous verse 101. Some of the People of the Book left their Book (Torah) and followed the whispers of satanic humans (syayatin) who taught magic during the time of Prophet Sulayman. This verse refutes the accusations of the Jewish group, that he got his power and wealth through magic (Zamakhsyari 1\/230), also rejects the Biblical statement, that Solomon had sinned by practicing shirk. He was accused of having married 700 foreign noblewomen and 300 mistresses. Because most of them were idol worshippers, Solomon was also influenced by them in his old age, tending to believe in idols and gods, unlike his father David (Book of Kings I, 11:1-10). The Harut and Marut mentioned in this verse are two people in Babylon, around the Furat River in Iraq, \"who pretended to be pious and pious. They taught magic to the people, so that the two of them were mistaken for two angels who descended from the sky, and who were taught They are thought to be revelations from Allah. They are very good at deceiving and maintaining the good faith of the people towards them, so they say to everyone who wants to learn from them, that \"We are only a test, do not become disbelievers,\" that is, they are the testers \"who will test you, will be grateful or will kufr. So we advise you, do not become disbelievers.\" They said this to give the impression that the knowledge they brought was from God, and their practice was for spiritual purposes. But the aim was only to destroy harmony. In this matter the Jews had many superstitions. They believe that the magic that was sent down to them was really from God. The arrival of the two angels was only to teach people. So the Qur'an came to refute their assumption, that it came from the sky, and severely criticized those who learned and taught it...\" ( al-Qasimi 1\/210). Quoting al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Zamakhsyari (1\/230) said that the word malakaini (two angels) is read malikaini (two kings). Muhammad Asad added, that Ibn Abbas and the following tabi'in, such as al-Hasan al-Basri, Abu al-Aswad adh-ahhak also read malikaini. As for the two angels, Jibril and Mikhail, they taught Solomon magic, as the Jews alleged. While the two kings were David and Solomon. About the word Wa ma unzila 'ala al-malakaini, the opinions of the commentators are not the same, some say ma nafiyyah (\"not passed down\"), some say ma ismiyyah or isim mausul (\"what is passed down\"), and so on. However, this grammatical difference does not need to be discussed here. By referring to the interpretations of Haqqani, Baidhawi and ar-Razi, we try to summarize what is stated in the interpretation of Abdullah Yusuf Ali, that \"The word 'angels' applied to Harut and Marut is a figurative word, which means 'good people, knowledgeable, knowledgeable (or wise) and have power\", as the word angel in modern languages is also used for women who are good and beautiful, and for them all the characteristics of beauty apply, which also mean kindness, knowledge, wisdom and strength. \"Harut and Marut lived in Babylon, the oldest center of knowledge, especially in astronomy. It is estimated that their time was around the time of the Ancient Kingdom in the East, very strong and advanced. Maybe even older, considering that Marut or Marduk were heroes who were deified and then worshiped as gods sorcery in Babylon. Slightly different from al-Qasimi's opinion above, he stated that Harut and Marut as good humans do not want to plunge into evil, they are clean from all deception. Science and art if learned by bad people can be used for evil Besides the practice of heinous magic, Satan also learns about true knowledge bit by bit and will use it for evil purposes. Harut and Marut don't want to hide their knowledge, but they have never taught it to anyone without giving a warning about it. the dangers and temptations of such knowledge when it is in the hands of bad people.They see it is not impossible for people The evil one will fall into disbelief and will become arrogant because of his knowledge. This knowledge is indeed a trial and temptation; if you have been given a warning, you know the danger. (Abdullah Yusuf Ali: C. 107). Yusuf Ali added, \"Among the many Israiliat stories in the Midrash (Book of Jewish Interpretations) there is a story about two angels who asked permission from Allah to descend to this earth, but then they succumbed to temptation, then as punishment they were hanged in Babylon with foot above. Stories about fallen angels who have received such punishments have been the belief of the early Christian circles as well. (See Second Epistle of Peter, 2, 4, and Epistle of Jude, verse 6). What does Satan learn from They changed Harut and Marut for evil purposes. Because it was mixed with falsehood and deceit, all amulets, spells and spells were born. or the harm they do will befall their own souls. They sell themselves to be slaves to evil (Idem). This verse actually does not refer to is the essence of magic. Whether the magic has a natural effect or is caused by something very mysterious, it is also not clear whether the magic can affect humans in an unusual way, or it doesn't have any effect at all. In short, Allah does not provide details. If Allah saw fit to explain the essence of magic and benefited humans, surely Allah would have explained it in detail. Then Allah explained that magic does not give the slightest benefit to humans, it even causes harm. Therefore, Allah threatens those who practice it with torment. Even the Jews already know that magic harms humans, and they should hate it. However, because there is an evil intention in their hearts to mislead Muslims, they also want to do it. For this reason, Allah denounces the act of magic and includes those who do it into the group of people who choose misguided acts. Furthermore, Allah confirms that in the hereafter they will not get the slightest happiness. Because those who have chosen the act of witchcraft, it means that they have violated the law contained in the Torah, even though in their own Book there is also a stipulation that those who follow the promptings of jinns, demons and sorcerers are the same as those who worship idols and statues. Allah further explains that the magic they do is very bad, Allah describes people who choose magic acts as their pleasure like people who sell faith for misguidance. This similar picture is used to reveal their veil, so that their consciousness can be opened and know that humans were created by God to serve Him. In other words, if they knew the error of people who studied and practiced magic, they would not have done it. But they have been far deceived, so that they think that magic is included in science, and they are satisfied with knowledge that is not proven true and does not have any effect on a person's soul except with Allah's permission."

Ra'ina, as explained above, means pay attention to us. But the Jews changed their words, so that what they meant was ra'unah which means very stupid, as a mockery of the Prophet. That is why Allah ordered the friends to exchange ra'ina with undhurna which has the same meaning as ra'ina. Allah teaches believers to say undhurna, which contains the intention of hope for Rasulullah SAW so that he can pay attention to the condition of his friends. Allah also pays attention to the believers to listen as well as possible to the religious lessons conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad which also contain orders to submit and carry out whatever the Prophet ordered, and stay away from what was forbidden. Then Allah in this verse warns that infidels, who do not want to pay attention to the teachings conveyed by the Prophet Muhammad will get a painful punishment."

They don't even want to admit that the Qur'an is the book that contains the most goodness and is full of guidance. It is with the Al-Qur'an that Allah gathers and unites the people and eliminates the disease of shirk that nests in their hearts, as well as gives some principles of rules for their life and livelihood. Likewise the polytheists, after they saw the fact that the longer the truth of the Qur'an appeared, and became a strong impetus for the struggle of the Muslims, they also tried their best to control the situation and destroy the struggle of the Muslims until it disappeared altogether. Even so, they will not be able to realize their dreams because Allah has determined His will, choosing the person he wants solely because of His grace. He is also the one who bestows priority on those who are chosen to be given prophethood. He is also the one who bestows goodness and virtue, so that all of His servants have fun in happiness. So it should not be if there is a servant of Allah who feels jealous of someone who has been given goodness and virtue, because the channel of goodness and virtue comes only from Allah."

As for the silver lining in making substitutions or amendments to verses, namely because the value of their benefits varies according to time and place, then they are abolished, or replaced with better laws, or with verses that are of the same value, is because the verses that are changed or replaced are no longer in accordance with the interests of society, so that if changes or changes are made it would be a wise action. For those who think that this verse is a prophetic sign (miracle) which is used as a confirmation of prophecy, then this verse means that Allah will not erase the prophetic sign that is used to reinforce his prophethood, or will not change the previous prophetic sign with a prophetic sign that will come later, or left the prophetic signs, because it has been several centuries. Except that Allah, who has unlimited power, gives a better sign of prophecy, in terms of its stability and the stability of that prophecy. Because of His unlimited power, the right to give prophetic signs to His prophets cannot be hindered. Substitution of verses sometimes occurs with verses that are lighter in law, such as abolishing the wife of a woman whose husband has died from a year to 4 months and 10 days, or with a verse that is the same as the law, such as an order to face the Baitulmakdis when carrying out prayers, which is changed to facing the Ka. 'bah. Or with more severe laws, such as war which was not obligatory on Muslims, it becomes obligatory. This verse is not only addressed to the Prophet Muhammad, but also addressed to the Muslims, who feel hurt to hear the jeers of the Jews against the Prophet Muhammad. People with little faith are certainly easily influenced, so their hearts easily become doubtful. That is why, Allah confirms that He is Omnipotent over everything, and if the will to enforce the law cannot be prevented, because legal matters are included in His power."

Their envy is not because of doubts about the contents of the Qur'an or not because they are driven by the truth contained in the Torah, but because of their lust, mental decline and resentment in their hearts. That is why they fall into the valley of error and sleaze. After that Allah gave guidance to Muslims how to deal with their actions. Allah ordered Muslims to face them politely and to forgive all their mistakes, also forbade them not to criticize them until the time came for Allah to give orders. Because it is Allah who will provide assistance to Muslims, so that Muslims can determine their attitude in facing their challenges, whether they must be fought or expelled.

Because in the prayer there is a prayer to Allah that is said by a servant as a serious statement of will, and strengthens the bonds of heart among believers, by praying in congregation and associating with them in the mosque. In this way, faith can develop and be strong, can also maintain a clean soul, can prevent oneself from doing heinous acts, and can increase one's fighting spirit to carry out the truth. If the Muslims follow these methods, surely they will receive help from Allah. The wisdom contained in issuing zakat is to strengthen the relationship between rich and poor Muslims, so that with a strong relationship there will be a strong and unanimous unity and unity of the Ummah. After that, Allah emphasized that prayer and zakat are the paths that must be taken to gain victory and happiness in this world and in the hereafter. This can be seen from Allah's statement that whatever good is done by the Muslims, surely they will receive a reward from Allah on the Day of Judgment in the fairest way possible. Allah commands Muslims to do good because Allah is truly All-Knowing of all practices, both large and small deeds.

This includes blocking all actions related to religious affairs, such as studying and practicing religion, iktikaf), prayers, remembrance and so on. 2. Demolishing Allah's mosques (places of worship). This includes actions, efforts, or actions aimed at destroying, tearing down, and obstructing the construction of mosques and so on. These two types of actions are unjust acts, because they result in the loss of the symbols of Allah's religion. The interpreters agree that the verse above implies \"general action\" and \"special action\". \"General actions\" are all kinds of actions related to preventing people from worshiping in mosques and actions to tear down Allah's mosques (places of worship). \"Special action\" is that the verse above was revealed to explain or imply that an event in history has occurred which has the same nature as the nature of the action or actions mentioned in the verse. The commentators differed on the events referred to in this verse. First opinion: The verse above indicates the actions of the Meccan polytheists who obstructed the wishes of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions who wanted to carry out the Umrah pilgrimage in the month of Zulhijah, the 6th year of Hijri (March 628 AD). The attitude of the polytheists finally gave birth to the Hudaibiah Agreement). The desire arose again because in the Hudaibiah Agreement the Prophet Muhammad and his companions were allowed to enter the city of Mecca in the year after the agreement was signed. Their actions are what Allah meant by blocking people from saying the name of Allah in the Masjidilharam and trying to tear down the mosque. ) The opinion of the first group further confirms that in the continuation of the verse there is a saying: ¦They are not fit to enter it except with fear (of Allah). ¦(al-Baqarah\/2:114) This verse illustrates that the time will come for the Muslims to enter the city of Mecca safely and securely and the polytheists of Mecca will enter the Grand Mosque with fear. This was proven later by the liberation of the city of Mecca by the Muslims and the polytheists of Mecca left their religion and converted to Islam. Second opinion: The verse above indicates the actions of king Titus (70 AD) from the Romans, son of the emperor Vespacianus, who destroyed the Temple of Solomon and the places of worship of the Jews and Christians in Jerusalem. The actions of the polytheists of Mecca prevented the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims from entering the city of Mecca to carry out the Umrah pilgrimage and the actions of King Titus destroying the Baitulmakdis, were included in \"general actions\". Whereas what is meant by \"special action\" in accordance with this verse is a second opinion because of the words \"knock down the mosque\" of Allah in the verse. The Meccan polytheists never tore down Allah's Mosque in the true sense of the word; they only pollute the Baitullah and prevent Muslims from worshiping. While Titus and his army really destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem and killed those who worshiped Allah. The continuation of the verse explains the characteristics that must be carried out by humans when entering the mosque of Allah, by submitting, obeying and purifying their obedience only to Allah. From this verse it can be understood that humans are prohibited from entering the mosque of Allah with arrogance and joy. It is forbidden to enter the mosque by people who intend to prevent people from worshiping in it, and people who intend to damage or tear it down. At the end of the verse, Allah threatens those who commit the above actions with humiliation in this world and a painful punishment in the hereafter. Humiliation in the world may be in the form of havoc, destruction and all kinds of humiliation either directly or indirectly felt by humans. The form of punishment in the hereafter only Allah knows better. Allah forbids humans to take all kinds of actions related to preventing people from praying, praying, iktikaf, studying religion, worshiping and other actions in upholding the symbols of Allah's religion in His mosques and efforts to damage and tear them down. This act is unjust in the sight of Allah, because it directly or indirectly results in the disappearance of Allah's religion on earth. This act was so unjust that Allah threatened the perpetrators with humiliation in this world and a painful punishment in the hereafter. What Allah has commanded is for humans to prosper Allah's mosques, build and maintain them properly, enter them with a sense of submission and surrender to Allah."

When we were in the middle of our journey, darkness gripped us, so we did not know the Qibla direction.\" A group of us said, \"We already know the direction of the Qibla, that is, that way, to the north. So they prayed and made a line on the ground. Some of us said, \"The direction of Qibla that way is towards the south.\" And they drew a line on the ground. . When it is dawn and the sun rises, the line points in a direction that is not the direction of the Qibla. When we returned from a trip and we asked the Messenger of Allah about this incident, the Prophet was silent and this verse was revealed.\" ) Allah swt confirms His ownership of this entire universe. He alone manages it, knows what goes on in it, both small and large. God's Word: ¦And He is with you wherever you are. And Allah is Seeing of what you do. (al-hadid\/57:4) Another Word of God: ¦There is no secret conversation between three people, but He is the fourth. And there were not five, but He was the sixth. And there is nothing less than that or more, but He must be with them wherever they are¦ (al-Mujadilah\/58:7) ... (They said), \"O our Lord, mercy and knowledge that is in You covers all things, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way (religion) ...\" (al-Mu'min\/40: 7) Therefore basically, wherever humans turn their faces in praying or worshiping, to the east, west, north, south, down, up, and so on, surely the prayers and worship are heard by Allah and reach Him. This verse refutes the belief that God has a place, that prayers or worship will be heard and reach God if the servant who is praying and worshiping is facing a certain direction or a place that is considered more noble than other places and so on. The word wajh has many meanings. In this verse it means \"presence\". Based on the verse above and the reason for its descent, the following laws can be determined: 1. Qibla is basically the entire direction. Wherever I turn, I will meet the face of Allah. To maintain the unity and unity of the Muslims, the Kaaba was designated as the Qibla direction. 2. If it is very dark and the Qibla direction is not known, then it is permissible to pray facing the direction that is believed to be the Qibla. If later it turns out that the direction is not the Qibla direction then the prayer is still valid. 3. For a person who is on a moving vehicle, he may turn in the direction he likes. Some scholars recommend turning towards the front of the vehicle."

The Word of God in the previous verse explains that \"everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to God and everything is subject to and obedient to Him\" is a statement of His power and might.

The word \"fa yakun\", which means \"then it was\" here does not necessarily mean that something happens immediately, but through a process that takes time. Every stage of the process that takes place in nature will certainly apply natural law, namely the provisions of Allah or sunatullah. The constructive engineering process from the form of availability of raw materials to the form of finished goods will require a process that is sometimes long and takes time. The process of producing petroleum or precious minerals takes a very long time according to human calculations. In the process of creating this universe, pay attention to the word of Allah in Surah al-Anbiya'\/21: 30, which means: ¦And do those who disbelieve do not know that the heavens and the earth were both one solid, then We separated them? both of them. And from water We made every living thing. So why don't they also have faith? (al-Anbiya'\/21: 30) The verse above explains that previously the heavens and the earth were one solid, then Allah separated the two of them to become one sky and the other one is the earth. But this separation process does not happen instantly. This process takes place in millions of years. The formation of a unified whole may require process and time, not instantaneous. Likewise in the creation of the first human, Adam as, Siti Hawa, Jesus as and we and other creatures that exist in this universe will all take place in the stages of the process according to what He has set, even though in fact Allah is able to change His provisions. that already exists becomes another provision according to His will."

The polytheists say, \"Why doesn't Allah directly speak to those who explain that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and the Qur'an was sent down from Allah, or come to them angels to explain it, or come the arguments that explain and prove Muhammad's prophethood?\" ?\" This verse explains that their words are the same as the words of those before them, which they spoke to the prophets who were sent to them. Allah also explained that what they said had the same reason, namely because of their denial and envy of Muhammad, not because there was no evidence or proof that Allah had brought.

Would your Lord be willing to send down dishes from the sky upon we?\" ¦ (al-Ma'idah\/5:112) It is further emphasized that unbelievers will not believe even if any information or evidence is sent down to them. Allah said: And if We sent down to you (Muhammad) writing on paper, so that they could hold it with their own hands, surely those who disbelieved would say, \"This is nothing but real magic.\" (al-An'am\/6:7) At the end of the verse it is explained that Allah always sends down evidence and arguments for everything, He explains it as clearly as possible. People who are pure in soul and heart will immediately accept these arguments and evidence and they will immediately believe them. Those who do not accept it are those whose hearts are jealous and diseased, their hearts are rough and closed. Allah said: Did they instruct each other about what was said. Actually they are a people who transgress limits.

If (the Qur'an) had not been from Allah, they would have found many contradictory things in it. (an-Nisa'\/4:82) Allah's Word: So do they not live up to the Qur'an or are their hearts already locked? (Muhammad\/47:24) From the verses above it is understood that reading the Qur'an without paying attention to its intent and meaning, interpreting it at will is the same as reading the Book by Jews and Christians. From the verse above it is understood that reading the books of Allah with actual readings must be done by humans. Reading the Book without actually reading it does not practice what is read, that means making fun of Allah's books and challenging Allah."

			"tafsir": "Ibrahim as tested by God with several sentences by assigning commands and prohibitions, such as building the Kaaba, cleansing it of all kinds of polytheism, sacrificing his son Ismail as, facing the king of Namrud, and so on. According to Mahmud Zahram, Ibrahim as had been given by Allah various experiences of tests and trials. He was ordered by Allah to slaughter his son, to travel back and forth between Sham and the Hijaz to see his children and wife who were in both places, and so on. ) Allah did not explain the various sentences that had been assigned to the Prophet Abraham. This gives an indication that the task that God has given is big, heavy and many. Even so, Ibrahim as had carried out the task and burden to the best of his ability, which brought him to a perfect position. And (the leaves) of Ibrahim who always fulfills the promise? (an-Najm\/53:37) The words, \"Indeed I will make you priests for all mankind,\" has nothing to do with the previous sentence, because there is no conjunction ('atf) at the beginning of the sentence. According to Muhammad Abduh), the sentence is a sentence that stands alone, has nothing to do with the previous sentence. The point is that the rank of priest (prophet and apostle) is solely the rank bestowed by Allah and only He Himself determines who He will give that rank to. Not all humans can achieve it even though he has carried out all the commands and stopped all the prohibitions of Allah. In other words, the rank of priest bestowed by Allah on Prophet Abraham was determined by His will, not because Prophet Abraham had completed and perfected the task given to him, so that he realized that the rank given by Allah was suitable for him, and so that he felt himself able to carry out the task and bear the burden that has been given. After being awarded the rank of \"imam\", Prophet Ibrahim as prayed to Allah so that the rank of \"imam\" would also be bestowed upon his descendants in the future. This prayer of the Prophet Ibrahim is a prayer that is in accordance with the sunatullah. According to sunatullah, children and offspring are a living connection for a person. An ideal that cannot be achieved while living in the world is expected so that children and descendants can convey it. The task of the priest is a holy and noble task because the assignment aims to achieve a holy and noble goal as well. Ibrahim as felt himself unable to achieve all the goals contained in his duties while living in the world. Because of that he prays to Allah that his children and grandchildren will also be awarded the rank of priest, so that the dreams that have not been achieved during his lifetime can be continued and achieved by his children and grandchildren. From the verse above it can also be understood that the way Prophet Abraham prayed was in accordance with the sunatullah so that it was the right way to pray and included a prayer that was granted by Allah. It was proven, later on, that all the apostles sent by Allah afterwards were from his descendants. From the word of Allah, \"My promise (this) is not about the unjust people\" it can be understood that among the descendants of the Prophet Abraham there were unjust people. In another verse Allah explains that there are descendants of Abraham who are unjust and there are those who do good. Allah said: And We bestow blessings on him and on Isaac. And among the descendants of the two there are those who do good and there are (also) those who openly do injustice to themselves. (as-saffat\/37:113) Allah said: And (Ibrahim) made (the sentence of monotheism) an eternal sentence for his descendants so that they would return (to the sentence of monotheism). (az-Zukhruf\/43:28) From this verse it can be understood that the Prophet Abraham made the sentence of monotheism a guide for his descendants. If among them there are those who associate partners with Allah, they are asked to return to the sentence of monotheism. \"Zalim\" (persecution) are various. Unjust to oneself is not carrying out orders and not abandoning Allah's prohibitions so that they get the wrath and punishment of Allah which brings disaster to oneself. Unjust to God's creatures, such as doing damage to the earth, breaking ties, unjust to humans and so on. From the word \"unjust\" it can be understood that for a priest there should not be unjust behavior. It is impossible for that rank to be given to people with dirty souls, people who do not carry out Allah's commandments and do not stop His prohibitions."

			"tafsir": "The Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims were ordered to remember when Allah made the Kaaba a place for people to gather, a safe place, and made Maqam Ibrahim a place of prayer. Maqam Ibrahim is a foothold for Ibrahim when building the Kaaba. Allah's order to Ibrahim and Ismail was to reassure the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims in facing the disbelief of the disbelievers and to explain to the polytheists, Jews and Christians that the religion brought by the Prophet Muhammad was in line with the religion brought by the Prophet Abraham, the religion of their ancestors. . There are two benefits that can be drawn from the verse above in connection with the establishment of the Kaaba: First, it is a gathering place for humans to worship. Since ancient times before the Prophet Muhammad was sent until now the Kaaba or Mecca has become a gathering place for people from all over, from all kinds of nations in order to respect and carry out the pilgrimage. Their hearts feel at ease living around the Kaaba. After they returned to their homeland, their hearts and souls were always drawn to it and they always aspired to return if there was a chance. Second, Allah swt made it a safe place. That is, Allah made the land around the Grand Mosque a land and a safe place for the people who are there. Since ancient times until now the Arabs venerate and purify it. The Arabs are known for their affinity for people or tribes who kill or hurt or humiliate their families. Wherever they met that person or tribe, they would carry out their revenge. Unless they met him in the Haram Land, they didn't bother him in the least. Meanwhile, since ancient times there have been many attempts by the Arabs themselves or from other nations to control the Haram Land or to damage the Kaaba, but Allah has always failed them, such as King Najasyi's Abraha attempt with his army to control the Haram Land and Kaaba. 'bah. They were destroyed. Allah said: Haven't you (Muhammad) noticed how your Lord has dealt with the army of elephants? Had He not rendered their deceit useless? And He sent them flocks of birds, which pelted them with stones of burnt clay, so that He made them like leaves to eat (worms). (al-Fil\/105:1-5) Don't they see that We have made (their country) a safe holy land, even though the people around it are robbing each other. Why (after the truth is clear) do they still believe in falsehood and deny Allah's favor? (al-'Ankabut\/29:67) Allah ordered Maqam Ibrahim to be used as a place of prayer. The function of the order is to present the order in the mind or for humans to follow what is ordered, as if the order was presented to them so that the order is embedded in their hearts and they feel that they are among those who are being ordered. Thus, the meaning of the verse is: The ancients who believed in Abraham were ordered to make part of Maqam Ibrahim a place of prayer. This order was also addressed to people who came later, who recognized Ibrahim as, as a prophet and apostle of Allah and acknowledged Prophet Muhammad, one of Abraham's descendants, as the last prophet. Allah ordered the Prophet Abraham to clean it in a literal and figurative sense. Cleaning in the true sense is cleaning from all kinds of objects that are considered unclean, such as all kinds of dirt and so on. Cleansing in a figurative sense is cleaning it from all kinds of actions that contain elements of shirk, acts of worshiping idols, acts that are forbidden, fights and so on. The order to clean the Ka'bah was even directed at the Prophets Abraham and Ismail, but it also included those who came after. Allah named the Kaaba which was erected the \"House of Allah\" (Baitullah). The naming does not mean Allah lives in or around the Kaaba. But the point is that Allah made the house a place of worship to Him and in worship facing towards the Kaaba. The wisdom of making the Kaaba the \"house of Allah\" and making it the direction to face in worshiping Allah, the Creator and Ruler of all creatures, so that humans feel that they can directly convey praise, expressions of gratitude, requests for help and requests for prayers to Allah. Humans are less able to express their thoughts in worshiping Allah if it is not done in a certain place and facing a certain direction. With a certain place and a certain direction, man can increase his faith at any time, deepen his knowledge, and increase his spiritual values. Because by doing so he feels as if God is in front of him so close, so that there is nothing between him and God. In another verse it is emphasized that wherever humans face in worship, pray they will meet the face of Allah, and reach Him, because Allah is All-Wise, All-Knowing. ) From the verse above it can be understood that the naming of the Kaaba as the house of Allah is only to make it easier for humans to make up their minds in worship. In principle, Allah is the Greatest, Most Knowing, Most Extensive."

			"tafsir": "The prayers of the Prophet Abraham have been granted by Allah. It was also emphasized about the nature of Ibrahim's prayer, namely security for the Haram land and the characteristics of those who are entitled to inherit, are good and noble people. What is meant by \"this country\" is the holy land of Mecca, in accordance with the word of Allah: O Lord, indeed I have placed some of my descendants in a valley that has no plants near your respected house (Baitullah), ¦ (Ibrahim\/14: 37) The holy land of Mecca is prayed for to guarantee its security from all kinds of disasters, such as enemy attacks, bloodshed, destruction as the previous peoples experienced due to their disobedience to Allah. Also prayed for sustenance in the form of fruits to the residents. Prophet Ibrahim's prayer was permitted by Allah with His words: \"Didn't We confirm their position in the safe land of the forbidden (holy land), which brought to that place fruits of all kinds (plants) as sustenance (for you) from the We? But most of them don't know. (al-Qasas\/28:57) The answer to Ibrahim's prayer was proven by the coming to Arabia of all kinds of fruits brought by people from all over the world. Ibrahim a.s. devoted his prayers to those who believe, but Allah's mercy is very numerous and infinite, given to those who believe and those who disbelieve. Allah says: To each (group), both this (group) (who wants the world) and (group) that (who wants the hereafter), We give help from the mercy of your Lord. And the mercy of your Lord cannot be hindered. (a1-Isra'\/17:20) What is meant by \"this group\", are disbelievers who give priority to worldly life and \"that group\" are believers who prioritize ukhrawi life compared to worldly life, as said in the previous verses. Next, the differences between the pleasures given to the believers and the pleasures given to the disbelievers are explained. The pleasure given to disbelievers is temporary pleasure, the little fortune they receive and feel while living in this world, then in the hereafter they will go to hell. Humans are rewarded and punishment is because of their own actions. The point is that humans become infidels and wicked is of their own will and will. Because the punishment that was inflicted on them was based on the actions they did of their own free will and will. Their disbelief in Allah causes them to be punished according to the sunatullah. Based on this sunatullah, all kinds of knowledge and human actions, both actions driven by lust or driven by their physical and spiritual will, will directly give traces of happiness or misery, a lot or a little, whether humans are willing to accept it or not. This is what is meant by the expression: Allah has made a dirty soul and despicable actions the target of His wrath and the target of His punishment in the hereafter, just as Allah has made a dirty and neglected body the target of a place of disease He has created."

			"tafsir": "The Arabs were reminded that the builders of the Baitullah were their forefathers named Ibrahim and his son Ishmael. Ibrahim is the ancestor of the Arab people through his son Ismail. While the Israelites through his son Isaac. All Arabs follow the Abrahamic religion. From this verse it can be understood that the builders of Baitullah were the Prophet Abraham and his son Ismail. The goal is to worship Allah and not for anything else, as a warning for himself, which will be remembered by his descendants in the future. The materials for building the Kaaba are ordinary objects, the same as other objects, and not objects that Allah sent down from the sky on purpose. All narrations which exaggerate the explanation of the Kaaba are inaccurate narrations, allegedly originating from Isra'i1iyat. ) Regarding al-Hajar al-Aswad ) 'Umar bin al-Khatthab ra said when he had kissed him: \"From Umar may Allah be pleased with him, that he had kissed Hajarul Aswad and said: \"Verily I already know that you are a rock that cannot harm and not benefit. If I don't see the Messenger of Allah kissing you, of course I won't kiss you.\" other friends. From the narrations above it can be concluded that the Black Stone is an ordinary stone. The command to kiss it is related to worship, such as the command to pray facing the Kaaba, the order to throw the jamrah at the time of performing the pilgrimage and so on. carried out solely carrying out Allah's orders. After Ibrahim and Ismail finished laying the foundation of the Kaaba, they both prayed: \"Accept from us\", (meaning accept our deeds as good deeds, be pleased and rewarded ...) \"Allah All-Hearing\" (meaning: Allah is All-Hearing our prayers), and \"Allah is All-Knowing\" (meaning: Allah is All-Knowing of our intentions and intentions to build and establish this Kaaba). From the verse above, it can be concluded that it is sunnah to pray and surrender all our deeds to Allah when we have finished doing them. With this submission, it means that the duty of a servant is to do pious deeds for Allah's sake, and Allah is the one who has the right to judge those deeds and reward them according to His judgment. From the verse above it can also be understood that Ibrahim as and his son, Ismail as, prayed to Allah after finishing doing a pious deed with the intention and intent of the deed solely being done and done for Allah's sake. Because the nature and form of the actions they did were believed to be in accordance with Allah's commands, the father and son also believed that their deeds would be accepted by Allah. This means that all kinds of prayers that are offered to Allah whose nature, form and purpose are the same as those made by Abraham with his son, must also be accepted by Allah and will certainly be given a good reward from Him. In the next verse (128) Ibrahim as continues his prayer, so that his descendants will become people who are submissive and obedient to Allah. The word \"Muslim\" (subject to obedience) implies that the people referred to by Abraham have the following characteristics: 1. Purify belief only in Allah. The heart of a Muslim only believes that the one who has the right to be worshiped and asked for help is only Allah Almighty. This belief departs from Muslim awareness that they are under the supervision and power of Allah. Only God can make a decision for him. 2. All deeds, obedience and submission, are done only because of and to Allah alone, not because of lust, not because people want to be praised and looked good, not because of rank and position, nor because of worldly gain. If that trust and submission is impure to Allah, then Allah will no longer be a protector for them. Allah said: Have you (Muhammad) seen the person who makes his desire his god. Will you be his protector? (al-Furqan\/25:43) Allah allows people to go astray who make their desires their god and lock their hearts to death, because Allah knows that they do not accept the instructions given to them. Allah says: Have you ever seen a person who made his desires his god and Allah let him go astray with His knowledge and Allah has sealed his hearing and heart and put a lid on his sight? ¦. (al-Jasiyah\/45:23) In verse 124 ago, Ibrahim as prayed that his descendants would be made priests, Allah replied, \"The descendants of the unjust Abraham are not included in that prayer.\" Therefore, in verse 128, Ibrahim as prays that some of his family will be made obedient to Allah. In the context of the verse above, there is an indication that what is meant by his descendants is Ismail as and his descendants who will be left behind in Mecca, while he himself returns to Sham. It was Ismail's descendants who inhabited Mecca and its surroundings, including the Prophet Muhammad. This is what is meant by the word of God. ¦. (Follow) the religion of your forefather Abraham. He (Allah) has named you Muslims long ago, and (also) in this (Qur'an)¦ (al-hajj\/22:78) Abraham and Ishmael asked Allah to show them how to do all kinds of worship in order to perform worship, places of wuquf, tawaf, sa'i, and so on, so that he and his children and grandchildren can carry out worship according to what Allah has commanded. In this verse, Ibrahim as begged Allah to accept his repentance, even though Abraham was a prophet and apostle, so was his son. All the prophets and apostles were kept by Allah from all kinds of sins (ma'sum). Therefore the meaning of the prayer of Ibrahim and his son is: 1. Ibrahim as and his son Ismail as asked Allah to forgive all unintentional mistakes, which are unknown and which he did without his own will. 2. As a guide for their descendants and followers in the future, so that they always purify themselves from all kinds of sins by repenting to Allah, and maintaining the sanctity of the place for performing the pilgrimage. \"Allah is the Recipient of repentance\" is Allah alone who accepts the repentance of His servants, nothing else. He always accepts the repentance of His servants who truly repent and gives taufik to always do good deeds. \"Allah Most Merciful\" is Allah Most Merciful to His servants who repent by removing sins and punishment from them. Furthermore, Ibrahim as prayed that Allah would raise an apostle from his descendants who purify obedience to Him, to give good news, give instructions and give warnings. Allah swt granted Prophet Ibrahim's prayer by raising from his descendants the prophets and apostles including Prophet Muhammad saw, the last prophet. The Messenger of Allah said: I am the prayer of Abraham and the one proclaimed as glad tidings by Jesus. (Ahmad's history). The characteristics of the apostles that Ibrahim as prayed for were: 1. Reading the verses of Allah that had been revealed to them, so that these verses would become lessons and guidance for their people. These verses contain teachings about the oneness of Allah, the existence of a day of resurrection and the day of vengeance, rewards for those who do good deeds and punishment for those who disobey, instructions to the good path, and so on. 2. Teach them the Bible and Al-Hikmah. The Bible is the Koran. Al-Hikmah is knowing the secrets, benefits, sharia laws, as well as the intent and purpose of the messengers being sent, namely to be a good example for them so they can follow the straight path. 3. \"Purify them\" is to purify themselves and their souls from all kinds of polytheism, disbelief, crime, bad manners, tend to destroy society and so on. Ibrahim (as) closed his prayer by praising his Lord, namely by mentioning His attributes, the Almighty and the Most Wise. The “Almighty” is that no one can contradict His words, and no one can prevent His deeds. \"All-wise\" is the One who creates all things and uses them according to their nature, uses and benefits. From this prayer of Prophet Ibrahim it can be understood that he begged his descendants to be given taufik and guidance, so that they can carry out and develop Allah's religion, foster human civilization and develop knowledge according to what Allah pleases."

(al-Furqan\/25:43) Allah allows people to go astray who make their desires their god and lock their hearts to death, because Allah knows that they do not accept the instructions given to them. Allah says: Have you ever seen a person who made his desires his god and Allah let him go astray with His knowledge and Allah has sealed his hearing and heart and put a lid on his sight? ¦. (al-Jasiyah\/45:23) In verse 124 ago, Ibrahim as prayed that his descendants would be made priests, Allah replied, \"The descendants of the unjust Abraham are not included in that prayer.\" Therefore, in verse 128, Ibrahim as prays that some of his family will be made obedient to Allah. In the context of the verse above, there is an indication that what is meant by his descendants is Ismail as and his descendants who will be left behind in Mecca, while he himself returns to Sham. It was Ismail's descendants who inhabited Mecca and its surroundings, including the Prophet Muhammad. This is what is meant by the word of God. ¦. (Follow) the religion of your forefather Abraham. He (Allah) has named you Muslims long ago, and (also) in this (Qur'an)¦ (al-hajj\/22:78) Abraham and Ishmael asked Allah to show them how to do all kinds of worship in order to perform worship, places of wuquf, tawaf, sa'i, and so on, so that he and his children and grandchildren can carry out worship according to what Allah has commanded. In this verse, Ibrahim as begged Allah to accept his repentance, even though Abraham was a prophet and apostle, so was his son. All the prophets and apostles were kept by Allah from all kinds of sins (ma'sum). Therefore the meaning of the prayer of Ibrahim and his son is: 1. Ibrahim as and his son Ismail as asked Allah to forgive all unintentional mistakes, which are unknown and which he did without his own will. 2. As a guide for their descendants and followers in the future, so that they always purify themselves from all kinds of sins by repenting to Allah, and maintaining the sanctity of the place for performing the pilgrimage. \"Allah is the Recipient of repentance\" is Allah alone who accepts the repentance of His servants, nothing else. He always accepts the repentance of His servants who truly repent and gives taufik to always do good deeds. \"Allah Most Merciful\" is Allah Most Merciful to His servants who repent by removing sins and punishment from them. Furthermore, Ibrahim as prayed that Allah would raise an apostle from his descendants who purify obedience to Him, to give good news, give instructions and give warnings. Allah swt granted Prophet Ibrahim's prayer by raising from his descendants the prophets and apostles including Prophet Muhammad saw, the last prophet. The Messenger of Allah said: I am the prayer of Abraham and the one proclaimed as glad tidings by Jesus. (Ahmad's history). The characteristics of the apostles that Ibrahim as prayed for were: 1. Reading the verses of Allah that had been revealed to them, so that these verses would become lessons and guidance for their people. These verses contain teachings about the oneness of Allah, the existence of a day of resurrection and the day of vengeance, rewards for those who do good deeds and punishment for those who disobey, instructions to the good path, and so on. 2. Teach them the Bible and Al-Hikmah. The Bible is the Koran. Al-Hikmah is knowing the secrets, benefits, sharia laws, as well as the intent and purpose of the messengers being sent, namely to be a good example for them so they can follow the straight path. 3. \"Purify them\" is to purify themselves and their souls from all kinds of polytheism, disbelief, crime, bad manners, tend to destroy society and so on. Ibrahim (as) closed his prayer by praising his Lord, namely by mentioning His attributes, the Almighty and the Most Wise. The “Almighty” is that no one can contradict His words, and no one can prevent His deeds. \"All-wise\" is the One who creates all things and uses them according to their nature, uses and benefits. From this prayer of Prophet Ibrahim it can be understood that he begged his descendants to be given taufik and guidance, so that they can carry out and develop Allah's religion, foster human civilization and develop knowledge according to what Allah pleases."

The religion in question is Islam. Allah confirms that the right religion by His side is Islam. Allah said: Verily the religion with Allah is Islam. There is no dispute among those who have been given the Book except after they have acquired knowledge, because of envy among them. Whoever denies the verses of Allah, then indeed, Allah is very quick in His reckoning. (Ali 'Imran\/3: 19) And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, he will not be accepted, and in the hereafter he will be among the losers. (Ali 'Imran\/3: 85) The religion that Abraham brought is also found in the book of Musa (Torah). Allah swt said: Verily this is found in the earlier books, (namely) the books of Abraham and Moses. (al-A'la\/87: 18,19) Say, \"We believe in Allah and in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants, and to what was given to Moses and Jesus and to what was given to the prophets from their Lord. ¦\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 136) Allah does not discriminate between the prophets and apostles He sent. Allah says: \"¦We do not discriminate between any of them, and we submit ourselves to Him.\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 136) Therefore, Allah ordered the Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims to believe in His prophets and messengers. Faith in the prophets and apostles and what they bring is included in the pillars of faith. From the words \"Ibrahim has bequeathed ...\" it can be understood: 1. That what was inherited was a very important thing. It is dangerous for life if the will is not carried out. Because of this, the words in the verse use: a. \"Will\" not \"command\". The word \"will\" indicates that something is very important. b. \"His children\", not \"others\". According to custom, bequeathing \"own children\" is expected to be more likely to be carried out compared to bequeathing other people. 2. In this verse it is stated that the bequest is Ibrahim as and Jacob as if the words were separated. This gives the understanding that those who were ordered to carry out the will were not only the descendants of Abraham and his grandson Jacob as (the Children of Israel), but that the will included all of Abraham's descendants and all Muslims, including the descendants of Ismail as."

The Prophet Muhammad and the Muslims while still in Mecca performed prayers facing Baitulmakdis, as was done by previous prophets; but he had the wish and hope that the qibla would move to the Kaaba which is in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Therefore, he tried to reconcile the two Qiblas by facing the Kaaba and Baitulmakdis at the same time, by praying to the south of the Kaaba facing north, because Baitulmakdis is also located to the north. After he migrated to Medina, of course it was no longer possible to do so, because the Kaaba was not located north of the city of Medina, and was no longer in the same direction as the Baitulmakdis. Thus, after being in Medina, he only faced Baitul Makdis when praying. This went on for 16 months, and he prayed that Allah would set the Kaaba as the Qibla, as a substitute for the Baitulmakdis. He raised his face to the sky, waiting for revelations from Allah SWT with full hope, without saying a word, as one of Allah's servants who is virtuous and surrenders to Him. Not long after, this verse came down which ordered the Qibla to be moved from the Baitul Makdis to the Kaaba. This verse was revealed in the month of Rajab, the second year of Hijri. This verse is at the same time an answer to the ridicule of the polytheists and the denial of the Jews and the hypocrites for the change of Qibla. People who deny and ridicule the change of Qibla, according to this verse, are called \"people who lack sense\" (sufaha'\/pandir). They criticized them even though they did not know the main issues in the matter of moving the Qibla. They do not realize that the four directions, namely east, west, north and south, all belong to Allah SWT, there is no special one over the other. Thus, when Allah commands His servants to face one direction in prayer, this is not because that direction is more noble than the others, but solely to test their obedience to His commands and regulations. The Jews, polytheists and hypocrites who deny the change of Qibla, are referred to by God as \"people who lack sense\" (pandir). They asked the reason for the move. The Prophet Muhammad was commanded by Allah to give us an answer by saying that all directions belong to Allah. If He determines the Qiblah for the Muslims, then it is to unite them in worship. It's just that people who lack sense have made these stones and buildings the subject of religion. In fact, the advantages and primacy of a direction are not due to its own substance, but because it has been chosen and determined by Allah SWT. At the end of this verse it is emphasized that Allah guides those whom He wills to the straight path. So anyone who obeys and obeys Allah's commands will certainly get His guidance to get happiness in this world and the hereafter. On the other hand, people who deny and disbelieve in His religion will certainly not receive His guidance or guidance."

In this way, the Islamic Ummah becomes a just and elected witness against people who rely on material things, who forget divine rights and tend to satisfy their lusts. They also bear witness to people who exaggerate in matters of religion so that they escape from all physical pleasures by withholding themselves from a normal life. The Islamic Ummah bears witness to all of them, because they are just and elected and in carrying out their daily lives they always take the middle way. Likewise, the Prophet Muhammad was a witness for his people, that his people are the best people who were created to guide people with good and evil. Then it was explained that the change of Qibla from the Baitulmakdis to the Kaaba was to test people, which of them truly believed and followed the Apostles and who were weak in faith, deviated from the straight path. It is true that moving the Qibla is felt very hard by those who are fanatical towards the first Qibla, because in general it is difficult for humans to change and abandon their habits. But those who receive guidance from Allah by knowing the laws of their religion and the secrets of the Shari'a, they are aware that performing worship by facing the Qibla is solely because of Allah's command, not because of some secret hidden in that place, and that the placement of the Qibla is to gather people in one direction as well as for the unity of the people. To remove doubts from some Muslims about the reward of their prayers as long as they face the Baitulmakdis first, Allah explains that He will never waste the faith and deeds of those who obey the Messenger because Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful."

So, this verse came down specifying the transfer of the Qibla from Baitulmakdis to the Grand Mosque.

Thus, all Muslims in various corners of the earth must face \"towards the Kaaba\" in prayer. To carry out this task they are required (wajib kifayah) to know earth science to find out the Qibla direction during prayer, just as they should know astronomy to find out the prayer times.

			"tafsir": "In this verse the good news is reaffirmed by explaining that Safa and Marwah are places of worship and whoever wants to perform the pilgrimage, he must perform sa'i between Safa and Marwah. Thus it is clear that the Muslims will surely succeed in conquering the city of Mecca, because Mecca is a place to perform the pilgrimage which is the fifth pillar in Islam that must be done by every Muslim who is able to perform it. Therefore, the Grand Mosque and its surroundings must be cleaned of idols and polytheism. Although there are differences of opinion between the priests of the madhhab regarding this sa'i law; there are those who regard it as the pillars of Hajj, such as Imam Malik and Imam Shafi'i, and there are those who consider it obligatory to perform Hajj, such as Imam Abu Hanifah, but it is clear that sa'i must be performed in performing the pilgrimage. In general, there is no difference between pillars and obligatory, but specifically in matters of Hajj, it is distinguished between the two. Pillars are things that must be done or cannot be replaced or redeemed. Compulsory is what must be done but if left behind must be replaced by paying a fine (dam). The question here is why in this verse it is stated \"there is no sin for him to perform the sa'i between the two\" even though it is an obligatory pillar, and it is impossible for someone who fulfills the pillars or is obliged to commit a sin. This is to eliminate the doubts of the Muslims about doing the sa'i, because the polytheists also do the sa'i in their worship, as if what the polytheists do is not permissible for the Muslims to do and they will sin if they do it. So it must be understood that the intention of doing the sa'i of the polytheists is different from that of the Muslims. Doing the sa'i is proof or manifestation of faith in Allah and obedience to His commands. Then Allah explained that whoever does good deeds or acts of worship more than what is obligatory for him (does the sunnahs), Allah will be grateful for those good deeds and Allah is All-Knowing of all the deeds of His servants. So do not hesitate to do good, because all of these deeds will be rewarded multiplied by Allah."

			"tafsir": "This verse came down regarding the Jewish priests. They hid from their people the qualities of the Prophet Muhammad mentioned in their holy book, so that the Jews would not convert to Islam. The People of the Book always hide the truth of Islam and the truth of the Prophet Muhammad even though this has been clearly and clearly written in their book. Those people deserve to be cursed by Allah and kept away from His mercy and compassion and it is also natural for angels and all humans to ask for curses for them. The law regarding the curse for people who hide knowledge that actually must be disseminated and developed is not only limited to the People of the Book, it even includes all people who act like that. This is confirmed by a hadith of the Prophet narrated by Abu Hurairah, he said: Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows but does not want to explain it to the questioner, Allah will shackle him with shackles from the fire of hell on the Day of Resurrection. (History of Ibn Majah from Abu Hurairah). Abu Hurairah said, \"If it were not for fear of Allah's threat in this verse (verse 159) I certainly would not have narrated a hadith from the Prophet.\" Therefore a Muslim is obliged to convey the knowledge he has, both in the form of religious knowledge and in the form of general knowledge, which is beneficial to society. If it is known that there will be a violation of religious law, or deviation from the true creed, such as the spread of bid'ah from schools of belief that are contrary to monotheism, the scholars must stand together to prevent this, both verbally and in writing. Thus the sanctity of religion and its purity will be maintained. The Jews were cursed because they always hid the truth. If they see something that is wrong or wrong, they just keep quiet and don't try to prevent it or fix it."

			"tafsir": "It is He who created the heavens and the earth for human needs, so humans should pay attention to and meditate on the grace of the Most Holy God because by paying attention to the contents of nature, all of them will increase their confidence in His oneness and power, their knowledge about the nature of His creation will increase, knowledge it can be used as desired by Allah, the All-Knowing. In this verse Allah swt \"guides\" people to want to see, pay attention and think about everything that exists and happens around them by mentioning His creations. The creation of the heavens and the earth is full of secrets and signs of Allah's greatness. There are God's creations that can be seen immediately and their benefits are obvious so that it is easy for us to understand them, but not least to understand them requires a long and deep process of thought and contemplation. Human efforts to know the secrets and signs of God's greatness have also encouraged them to get closer to Him. Understanding the greatness, sophistication and harmony of this universe has made many scientists more aware and convinced that in fact everything in this universe was intentionally planned, made, regulated and maintained by Him. The development of science and technology has brought people to the conclusion that the Solar System which consists of millions of stars maybe even more (including our earth) is only a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy which contains more than 100 billion stars. And the Milky Way is only one of more than 500 billion galaxies in the known universe. In fact, all the stars in the universe are in their respective predetermined orbits (adz-dzariyat\/51:7). Orbits within the universe also belong to galaxies moving at high speeds in predetermined orbits. As they move, none of these celestial bodies cross their orbits or collide with other celestial bodies. Likewise regarding the earth that He created, everything shows the perfection of its creator. Allah says which means: ¦And on this earth there are signs of Allah's power for those who believe ¦.. (adz-dzariyat\/51: 20) A modern science encyclopedia describes the chemical elements that exist on our earth have amazing variety. Some of them are rare because they are hard to find but some are abundant. Some are visible to the naked eye because they are in the form of liquids and solids, but some are invisible because they are gases. This fact should be able to guide us to be more impressed with the majesty and oneness of its Creator, Allah swt. The appearance of day and night alternately invites us to think about the existence of a perfect arrangement. The question that arises is \"who arranged it all?\" The alternation of night and day, and the alternation between the two, the length and shortness of time, and the existence of various seasons are the perfect climatic arrangements that are comfortably conditioned to be habitable by humans. The word al-fulk in this verse means ark or boat. To build a boat, knowledge of the properties of water, the movement of wind, air, clouds related to the seasons is required, basic principles of fluid physics and other basic laws, such as Archimides' law for floating bodies, or design and construction concepts. Finally humans can make ships or boats to sail across the ocean so they can explore all corners of the earth. In this alternation of night and day there are indications about time and direction because these two things are needed in sailing. From this natural phenomenon, humans also create astronomy and knowledge about the weather, which are very useful for meeting human needs. Allah says, which means the following: \"¦. And it is He who made the stars for you, so that you may make them guides in the darkness on land and at sea... (al-An'am\/6: 97). Then \"He sent down from the sky in the form of water\". In the Qur'an there are a number of verses that explain how Allah sends down rain. The verses referred to are ar-Rum\/30: 48; Qaf\/50:9-11; Gafir\/23: 18 and 48-50; al-hijr\/15: 22; Fathir\/35: 91; al-A'raf\/7: 57; al-Jasiyah\/45: 5; ar-Ra'd\/13 :17; al- Mulk\/67:30; az-Zumar\/39: 21; an-Nur\/24:43 and al-Waqi'ah\/56: 68. The occurrence of rain can simply be explained as follows. Beginning with the evaporation of water caused by the heat air that heats the surface of the sea. Heating results in a shift of water molecules which then becomes steam. When the vapor rises to the top, clouds are formed which are getting thicker. Because of the cold and weight of the thick clouds earlier they turn into water droplets which then fall h to earth. That is what is called rain\". ¦ then with that water He revived the earth after it died (dry) and He spread on the earth all kinds of animals¦ (al-Baqarah \/ 2: 164) With this water comes life with various plants on the surface the earth, which is then used by animals and humans as a source of their life. Finally life on earth develops as we can see. This is also hinted at in the word of God which means the following: ¦.And you see the earth is dry, then when We send down water on it, the earth lives and is fertile and grows various kinds of beautiful plants¦ (al-hajj\/22: 5). The rain that supports life for plants, animals and humans is proof that Allah is the One and Most Creator. if viewed from the point of view of its usefulness, then this fact is a divine blessing. It should always be paid attention to and investigated what is mentioned in this verse, namely: 1. The creation b this earth that human beings live on and what is stored in it is a treasury and wealth that will not be exhausted either on land or at sea. All of that is God's grace and love for humans, therefore humans must use, maintain and preserve it for a good life from generation to generation. 2. The creation of the heavens with stars and planets all walk and move according to Divine order and rules. There is nothing that deviates from these rules, if there is a deviation, there will be a collision between one and another and this whole nature will perish. This will not happen unless the creator himself, namely Allah the Almighty has willed it to happen. 3. The exchange of night and day and the difference in the length and shortness of the night and day in several countries due to differences in their locations, all of these bring enormous benefits and benefits to humans. Even though the causes have been known by means of astronomy, human research in this matter must be intensified and deepened so that with this knowledge humans can be even more advanced in utilizing God's grace. 4. Ark that sail the seas to carry people from one country to another and to carry commercial goods to advance the economy. For people who have never sailed in the middle of a vast ocean, maybe this will not attract attention, but for sailors who always sail the seas who experience how great the attacks of waves and storms are, especially when it is pitch black at night, this is will surely bring to the awareness that indeed everything is under the control of and under the almighty and almighty God. 5. Allah swt sends down rain from the sky so that with rain water the dead or dry earth can become alive and fertile, and all kinds of animals can also live their lives in the presence of this water. It can be described, how if rain does not fall from the sky, all land will become desert, all living things will die and be destroyed by drought. 6. Changing the direction of the wind from one place to another is a sign and proof of Allah's power and the greatness of His mercy to humans. In the past, before there were fireships, it was sailing ships that were used to cross the wide seas; and if there is no wind, of course the ship cannot move to its destination. Among these winds there are those that drive the clouds to the places God wills, some even marry plant extracts, and many other hidden secrets that humans have not been able to investigate and know. 7. Likewise, one must think about and pay attention to the greatness of God's favor to humans with the accumulation of clouds between the heavens and the earth. In short, all the blessings created by Allah, including what is mentioned in verse 164, should be thought about and contemplated and even discussed and examined, to instill deep faith in the heart, and to advance knowledge which also leads to recognition of the oneness and greatness of Allah."

They forbid according to their own will to eat several types of animals such as bahirah, namely a female camel that has given birth five times and the fifth child is a male, then the ear is split open; and wasilah, namely the lamb which has two lambs, one male and one female, then the male child cannot be eaten and must be handed over to idols. Even though Allah does not forbid eating that type of animal, he has even explained what is forbidden to eat in His words: It is forbidden for you (to eat) carrion, blood, pork, (animal meat) slaughtered in the name of other than Allah, and ( animals that die) are suffocated, beaten, fallen, gored, and eaten by wild animals, except for those that you have slaughtered, and (unlawful for you) those that are slaughtered for idols. And (it is also forbidden) to draw fate with arrows, that is an act of wickedness. (al-Ma'idah\/5: 3). Everything other than what is mentioned in this verse is permissible to eat, while bahirah and wasilah are not mentioned in that verse. Indeed, some scholars are of the opinion that besides what is mentioned in the verse, there is something else that is forbidden to eat based on the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, such as eating animals with sharp teeth or strong claws. God told humans to eat good food that is found on earth, namely the planet which is known as the home of living things such as humans, animals, plants and others. Meanwhile, food that is forbidden by some tribes according to their wishes and regulations made by themselves is lawful to eat, because Allah has not made that food forbidden. Allah only forbids certain types of food as mentioned in verse 3 of sura al-Ma'idah and in verse 173 of sura al-Baqarah. Apart from what is forbidden by Allah and other than what is mentioned in the hadith according to the opinion of some scholars, it is halal, it is permissible to eat. The tribes only forbade certain types of plants and animals based on the laws they set by following the traditions they inherited from their ancestors, and because they indulged in lust and whims of Satan alone.

He is the one who is worshiped, obeyed all His commands and shunned all His prohibitions. If someone prohibits something or makes it lawful, in fact that person has equated himself with Allah, and may not be followed. Justifying that person is the same as associating partners with Allah and acknowledging that besides Allah there are those who have the right to be justified and whose laws are obeyed. Such is the case with polytheists, they worship and obey orders other than Allah in the form of idols, leaders who control these idols, they are not recognized by Allah and His Messenger as believers as long as they have such beliefs. Here it is emphasized that there are only four types of food that are forbidden. There are also several types of animals that are forbidden to eat based on verses like those mentioned above. Then it was explained again that it is not a sin for people in an emergency to eat food that is forbidden, if they are really in an emergency, such as there is no more food to eat, and if not eaten it will bring great danger or death. Actually they didn't want to even feel disgusted eating it, but just to save his soul. As for eating more than that, the law remains unlawful. This is Allah's will and Allah does not burden a servant more than he can bear. According to the majority of scholars, food that is unlawful to eat is also unlawful to be traded, because it is unclean, except for the Hanafi and Zahiri scholars who say that anything that can be used can be traded, such as buying and selling animal dung and unclean waste, because it is needed for use in gardens. gardens and others. The verse clearly explains that Muslims are prohibited from eating carrion, blood and pork. Blood and carrion is obvious, because it contains a lot of poison. As for pork, it may need further explanation. According to scientists, pigs are animals that are shaped like barrels, with short legs. The wild boar that exists today is thought to be the ancestor of domesticated pigs. Wild boar can run very fast and is good at swimming. They include eating all kinds of food, from grass to carrion. Even farm pigs like their own excrement. Thus, it is not a matter of hygiene in pig farming that needs to be discussed here, but pigs are not naturally clean animals. No matter how sophisticated the hygiene system is implemented, the nature of the pig does not change. In accordance with their natural way of life which is very dirty, they have a high content of antibodies (a substance produced by the body to defend itself against disease). The high content of antibodies stored in pork is unfavorable to the health of humans who eat it. This includes the high cholesterol and fat content in pork. Pig sexual maturity is very fast. Male pigs are mature and can fertilize at the age of eight months. While sows can give birth after the age of six months. They just stopped having children at the age of 15 years. Sows can give birth to up to 20 pigs in one fertilization. The sex drive of pigs is huge. The growth of piglets is very fast. When born, they weigh about 2 kg. After six months, they can weigh up to 100 kg. Pigs can weigh up to, the largest found, 363 kg. All of this is possible because pigs have very high growth hormones and sex hormones. This is what causes pork to have a lot of fat. These two hormones (which are present in high amounts) also add to the long list of reasons why pork is not good for consumption. Several medical studies state that pigs contain several viruses that can cause a person who eats them to contract a disease. In addition, one study states that one in six people in America get germs in their muscles due to consuming pork. This can happen because the pig's body contains several types of dangerous tapeworms. It is well known that Trichinellosis tapeworm disease is transmitted through pork. Tenosolium is one of the names of worms that reproduce in the digestive tract which can reach up to eight meters in length. Some of the diseases that are widely spread by diseases with pigs as the host can be seen below. In 1968 it was discovered that a type of germ from pork was the cause of the death of so many patients in the Netherlands and Denmark. In 1918, Swine flu hit many parts of our world and killed millions of people. This flu re-emerged in 1977, and in the United States when immunization was carried out which cost up to 135 million dollars. The outbreaks of bird flu and SARS in 2005-2007 were also inseparable from the role of pigs as intermediate hosts for several viruses from other animals that can also infect humans, such as the SARS virus and bird flu. Several other diseases that can be caused by pigs are influenza, inflammation of the brain (Japanese B. Encephalitis), inflammation of the mouth and liver (Stomatitis and Myocarditis) and others. One of the new findings that was revealed after the rise of genetic engineering was the discovery of viruses present in pigs that were not killed by burning or normal cooking. There is also a worm called Trichine which can enter and live in the human body for years. Pork fat contains complicated fats, including triglycerides, and its meat contains very high cholesterol, up to fifteen times more than beef. The Encydopedia Americana explains the comparison between the fat content found in pigs, sheep and buffalo. In the same weight content, pork contains 50% fat, sheep 17%, and buffalo no more than 5%. Several parts of pigs are known to be used to replace human organs. For example, pig heart valves are the best substitutes for human heart valves. But you need to pay close attention, because pigs are also the home of many bacteria, viruses and parasites that are harmful to humans, so the possibility of infecting humans who receive pig organs is very high."

The goods that they get in this world by misguided paths, in the hereafter will become a blazing fire that they always swallow and enter their stomachs so that they are very tormented. Besides that, Allah is very angry with them, so that no matter what they complain about and in any way they ask forgiveness to be merciful, Allah will not listen to their complaints and requests. Allah will not want to talk to people who always hide what He has revealed and are always disobedient to Him. Allah will not erase their sins nor will they be cleansed from mistakes and misguidance in this world, even for them a very painful punishment has been prepared."

			"tafsir": "This verse is not only addressed to Jews and Christians, but also includes all people who follow religions sent down from heaven, including Muslims. In verse 177, Allah explains to all mankind that virtue is not simply turning one's face towards a certain direction, either east or west, but true virtue is having faith in Allah truly, faith that resides in the heart. who can reassure the soul, who can show the truth and prevent oneself from all kinds of impulses of lust and evil. Believing in the hereafter as the ultimate goal of the life of this world which is lacking and mortal. Believe in angels who among their duties are intermediaries and bearers of revelation from Allah to the prophets and apostles. Believe in all the books revealed by Allah, be it the Torah, Bible or Al-Qur'an and others, do not be like the People of the Book who believe in some of the books revealed by Allah, but do not believe in some others, or believe in some verses -verses they like, but do not believe in verses that are not to their liking. Believe in all prophets without distinguishing between one prophet and another. This faith must be accompanied and marked by real deeds, as described in this verse, namely: 1. a. to give loved ones to close relatives who need them. Family members who can afford it should prioritize giving a living to those who are closer to them. b. provide financial assistance to orphans and helpless people. They need help and assistance to make a living and continue their education, so that they can live peacefully as human beings who are useful in their community. c. to give wealth to travelers in need, so that they are not stranded on their way and avoid various difficulties. d. giving wealth to people who are forced to beg because there is no other way for him to cover his needs. e. provide assets to abolish slavery, so that he can obtain the independence and freedom he has lost. 2. Establishing prayers, which means carrying them out on time, solemnly, complete with the pillars and conditions. 3. Paying zakat to those who are entitled to receive it as stated in surah at-Taubah verse 60. In the Qur'an, when the command is stated: \"to establish prayers\", it is always accompanied by the order: \"to perform zakat\", because between prayer and Zakat has a very close relationship in carrying out worship and virtue. Because prayer cleanses the soul while zakat cleanses wealth. Issuing zakat for humans is indeed difficult, because zakat is a very cherished expenditure of one's own assets. Therefore, when there is an order for prayer, it is always accompanied by an order for zakat, because virtue is not enough for the soul alone but must also be accompanied by wealth. For this reason, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the companions agreed that it was obligatory to fight those who did not want to pay their zakat. 4. Keep promises for those who have entered into agreements. All kinds of promises that have been promised must be kept, both promises to Allah such as oaths and vows and some of them, as well as promises to humans, except for promises that are contrary to Allah's law (Islamic law) such as promises to commit immorality, then it is not permissible (haram) to do this. This is confirmed by the words of Rasulullah saw: There are three signs of a hypocrite: namely, when he says, he always lies, when he promises, he always does not keep his promises, when he is trusted, he always betrays. (Muslim history from Abu Hurairah ra). 5. Patience in the sense of being steadfast, holding back and struggling in overcoming adversities, namely life's difficulties such as economic crises; afflictions, such as illness or trials; and in war, that is, when war is raging. They are the people who are true in the sense according to their attitude, speech and actions and they are the people who are pious."

If a free person kills an independent person, then kisas applies to the free killer. 2. If a slave kills a slave (slave), then kisas applies to the killer slave. 3. If a woman is killed, then the person who gets the death penalty is that woman. Thus according to the sound of this verse, but what is the punishment if things like the following happen: a. When a free man kills a slave. b. If a Muslim kills a kafir zimmi (a non-Muslim who becomes a citizen of Islam). c. When a crowd kills a person d. When a man kills a woman. e. When a father kills his son. The scholars gave the results of their respective ijtihad as follows: According to the Hanafi school, in problem no. 1 and no. 2 The law is that the murderer must be put to death, even though the degree of the murdered person is considered lower than that of the killer, for the following reasons: 1) From the beginning of verse 178 to the words of al-Qatl, it is considered a perfect sentence. So, there is no difference between the degree of the person who kills and the person who is killed. Meanwhile, the following words, namely free people and free people, slaves to slaves and women to women, only strengthen the law, so that they do not act like in the time of ignorance. 2) This verse is sanctioned (no longer valid punishment) with verse 45 surah al-Ma'idah\/5 which does not distinguish human degrees and religions. According to the Maliki and Syafi'i schools, on issue No. 1 and No. 2, murderers are not killed, because equality is a requirement for them on the grounds that: 1) The sentence in the verse is not considered complete if it does not reach the words: (women with women). So independent with free, slave with slave and woman with woman. This equation is a requirement, while verse 45 Al-Ma'idah is generally ordained with this verse. 2) Word of Rasulullah saw: Believers will not be killed for killing unbelievers. (Al-Bukhari history from Ali bin Abi Talib) Issue no. 3: according to the majority of scholars, all were sentenced to death because each had taken part in the murder. problem no. The law is in accordance with the consensus of a friend, namely that murderers must be sentenced to death, because it is considered that there is no fundamental difference between men and women. problem no. 5 the law is not sentenced to death for killing his child, in accordance with the words of the Prophet Muhammad: Fathers are not killed for killing their children (Al-Bukhari History from Umar) other punishments were imposed on him, such as diat, fines, and so on, as explained in detail in the fiqh books. Furthermore, Allah SWT explained that there is another possibility that is lighter than the kisas, namely \"Whoever gets forgiveness from a brother who was killed, then let the person who is forgiven pay the debt to the brother (heir) who forgives in a good way.\" This means that the mandatory kisas punishment is dropped and replaced with a diat punishment that must be paid properly by the killer. Then in closing this verse Allah warns the heirs who have forgiven, so that they do not do unreasonable things to the party who has been forgiven, because if he does things that are not fair, then it means that the act has exceeded the limit and will receive a severe punishment. pain on the Day of Resurrection."

Because with the implementation of classical law, human beings will not arbitrarily commit murder by following their own desires, and base the killing on the feeling that they are stronger, richer, more powerful and so on. Tafsir al-Manar has given a lengthy description of the merits of the punishment of kisas and the punishment of death brought by the Qur'an; by providing various comparisons about legislation, as well as human behavior, both in the east and in the west, and providing an analysis of several opinions of legal scholars. Tafsir al-Manar says: if we pay attention to the previous and current ummah's Shari'a concerning the punishment prescribed for murder, then we see that the Qur'an is really in a very reasonable middle line. Because the punishment given to murderers during the period of ignorance was always based on the strength and weakness of the tribe. One who was killed from a strong tribe, in return usually killed 10 people from the weak side of the killing tribe. Tafsir al-Manar added, \".... Some people (criminals), if the punishment for a murderer is only set to serve a few years in prison, they will not be deterred, some even want to go to jail to get protection and a living for free . For a person like this, of course the best punishment is kisas, killed if he kills another person. But if the heir who was killed apologizes, then the kisas punishment falls and is replaced by another punishment, namely paying a diat (fine).\" These are some of the summary descriptions of Tafsir al-Manar."

			"tafsir": "In general, according to verse 180, Allah obliges a believer to make a will for a believer who feels that his death is near, with signs that he will die. The obligation to make a will, for people who have assets, so that after death they can set aside a part of the assets that will be given to their parents and close relatives in a good (fair and reasonable) manner. The mujtahid scholars, in establishing a positive testament law from verse 180, require discussion and research of other verses in the Qur'an and of the hadiths of the Prophet that have something to do with this issue, so that they come up with opinions, among others : 1. The majority of scholars gave the opinion that this testament verse 180 has been sanctioned (legally abolished) by the inheritance verses which were revealed in detail in surah an-Nisa' verses 11 and 12 with the following reasons: a. The words of the Prophet Muhammad: Verily, Allah SWT has given each person his own rights, so there is no will for heirs (Ahmad and al-Baihaqi's history from Abu Umamah al-Bahili). This hadith, although not mutawatir, has been well received by Islamic scholars for a long time. b. Scholars agree that the verses on the inheritance were revealed after this testament verse. 2. The scholars who are of the opinion that this testamentary verse is sanctioned by the inheritance verses, are also divided into 2 groups: the first group says that there is no obligatory will, both for relatives who are heirs and relatives who are not heirs. The second group is of the opinion that what is passed is only a will to the heir's relative, in accordance with the verses of the roseis, but for close relatives who are not included as heirs, the will is still legally obligatory in accordance with this will. 3. According to Abu Muslim al-Isfahani (a scholar who does not recognize the existence of texts in the verses of the Qur'an) and Ibn Jarir ath-Tabari, that this will 180 verse was not sanctioned by the verses of the roses for the reasons, among others : a.There is no contradiction between this testament verse and the verses of the roseis, because this testament is a gift from God. Therefore, an heir can receive a share from the will in accordance with paragraph 180 of this, and from the inheritance in accordance with the provisions of the inheritance clauses. b. If there is a conflict between the verses of this will and the verses on inheritance, then a compromise can be made, namely the verses of this will are general in nature, meaning that it is obligatory to testament to every relative, both heirs and not, while the verses of the inheritance are specific. So the obligation to bequeath as in paragraph 180 remains valid, so it does not conflict with the inheritance clauses. In verse 180 it is explained again that the will is enforced if there is a large amount of property to be left behind by the person making the will. Scholars who give opinions about how many assets require a will. Details of the opinions of these scholars can be found in fiqh books. But no matter how many arguments are put forward, a sound mind can conclude that the assets left behind are certainly not small because a will cannot exceed one-third of the total amount of assets left behind, after having issued what must be issued in advance, such as debts and expenses as necessary for funeral purposes. If the will is more than one-third, it must obtain the approval of the heirs. If someone disagrees, then the will only applies to a third of the amount of the assets left behind, in accordance with the words of the prophet Muhammad saw: Indeed, Allah has allowed giving one third of your assets when you are close to death (death) to increase your virtues. (Ad-Daraquthni history from Mu'adz bin Jabal) So if the wealth is small, the will is inappropriate and unnatural to be issued. After that this verse emphasizes that what was bequeathed was given and shared in an orderly manner, meaning in a good, fair and reasonable manner. No one should receive a little, while others receive a lot, except in cases that are quite reasonable, namely people who receive more, because they have so many needs compared to others."

			"tafsir": "Scholars have provided many descriptions of the wisdom of fasting, for example: to enhance character, raise awareness and compassion for the poor, weak people who are unable to make ends meet, train their minds and bodies, improve their health and so on. There is some truth to the above description, although it is not easy for everyone to feel. Because, hunger, thirst and other consequences of fasting do not always remind the suffering of others, instead it can encourage him to look for and prepare various kinds of food during the day to quench his hunger and thirst when breaking the fast at night. Likewise, it will not be easy for everyone who fasts, that fasting helps health, even though doctors have given scientific explanations, that fasting really can cure some diseases, but there are also diseases that do not allow fasting. If we pay attention to the command to fast in the month of Ramadan, then at the beginning of verse 183 Allah directly shows this obligatory order to believers. A person who has faith will obey the fasting command wholeheartedly, because he feels that physical and spiritual needs are two basic elements for human life that must be developed with various exercises, so that they can be utilized for a peaceful, happy life in this world and the hereafter. In this verse 183 Allah obliges fasting to all human beings who believe, as was obligated to people before them so that they become pious people. So, fasting is really important for the life of a believer. If we investigate various religions and beliefs at this time, it is found that fasting is one of the common teachings to restrain lust and so on. The command to fast was sent down in the month of Sha'ban in the second year of Hijri, when the Prophet Muhammad saw began to build an authoritative government and regulate a new society, so one can feel that fasting is very important in shaping human beings who can accept and carry out big and holy tasks. ."

			"tafsir": "Verse 184 and the beginning of verse 185, explain that fasting is obligatory for several days, namely in the month of Ramadan according to the number of days in Ramadan (29 or 30 days). The Great Prophet Muhammad saw, since the revelation of the fasting order until his death, he always fasted in the month of Ramadan for 29 days, except for once, the month of Ramadan was even 30 days. Even though Allah has made fasting obligatory in the month of Ramadan for all believers, Allah, the All-Wise, gives relief to sick people and travelers, not to fast in the month of Ramadan and replace it on other days outside of that month. In this verse, it is not specified the type\/nature of the limitation and degree of illness and the traveler, so the scholars gave the results of their respective ijtihad, including the following: whether the journey is far or near, according to the word of this verse. This opinion was pioneered by Ibn Sirin and Dawud az-Zahiri. 2. It is permissible not to fast for anyone who is sick who really finds it difficult to fast because of his illness. The size of the difficulty is left to the sense of responsibility and faith of each. This opinion was pioneered by some commentators. 3. It is permissible not to fast for a person who is sick or a traveler with conditions, if the illness is severe and will affect the safety of the soul or the safety of some of his limbs or increase his pain when he fasts. Also for those who are travelers, if the journey is long distance, the size is at least 16 farsakhs (approximately 80 km). 4. There is no difference of opinion regarding a traveler's journey, whether on foot, or in any way, as long as it is not for committing immoral acts. After that Allah explained in the middle of verse 184 that the translation is, \"And it is obligatory for people who are hard to do it (if they don't fast) pay fidyah, (ie) feed the poor.\" According to that verse (184), whoever really finds it hard to fast, he may replace it with fidyah, even if he is not sick and is not a traveler. Including people who are hard to do fasting is: a. Parents who are unable to fast, if he does not fast replaced with fidyah. b. Pregnant and lactating women. According to Imams Syafi'i and Ahmad, if a pregnant woman and a woman who is breastfeeding are concerned that the health of her fetus\/baby will be disturbed, then they do not fast, then it is obligatory for both of them to make up the missed fast and pay fidyah. If they are worried that their own health will be affected and they are not worried about the health of their fetus\/infant, or they are worried about their health and that of their fetus\/infant, then they do not fast, then it is obligatory for them to make up the fast. Meanwhile, according to Abu Hanifah, pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding in all the matters mentioned above, it is enough just to make up for fasting. c. Sick people who are unable to fast and whose illness has no hope of recovery, are only required to pay fidyah. d. Regarding workers and farmers whose livelihood is only from hard work and toiling every day, in this case the fiqh scholars expressed the following opinions: 1) Ibn Hajar and Imam al-Azra'i have issued a fatwa, \"Indeed it is obligatory for those who rice harvesters and so on and those similar to them, intend to fast every night of Ramadan. If during the day it turns out that he experiences severe difficulties or suffering, then he may break his fast. If not so, he cannot break his fast.) 2) If someone whose search depends on a hard job to cover the necessities of life or the needs of the people who must be paid for where he cannot stand fasting, then he may break his fast at that time,\" (meaning he has to fast since morning). The end of verse 184 explains that people who willingly do good deeds by paying fidyah more than their size or feeding more than a poor person, then the deed is good for him. After that Allah closes this verse by emphasizing that fasting is better than not fasting."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that in the month of Ramadan, the Qur'an was revealed. In connection with this important event, there are several Qur'anic information that can be used as a reference for determining the time of this revelation. These verses include surah al-Qadar\/97: 1, this verse implies that the Qur'an was revealed on a night full of glory or the night of qadar. Surah ad-Dukhan\/44: 3, this verse implies that the Qur'an was revealed on a blessed night. Surah al-Anfal\/8: 41, this verse indicates that the Qur'an was revealed to coincide with the meeting between the two armies, namely the Islamic forces led by the Prophet Muhammad and the Quraysh army commanded by Abu Jahl, in the Battle of Badr which took place in the 17th of Ramadan. From some of this Qur'anic information, the scholars determined that the Qur'an was revealed for the first time on the night of qadar, that is a night full of glory, which is also a night full of blessings, and this occurs on the 17th of Ramadan, coinciding with meeting and the outbreak of war between the Islamic forces and the infidel Quraysh army at Badr, at the time of the revelation that Muhammad was 40 years old. Furthermore, this important event is designated as the first revelation and is always commemorated by Muslims every year around the world. With regard to the night of qadar, there is a difference in its determination, as the first time the Qur'an was revealed, and the night of qadar which the Prophet Muhammad recommended to Muslims to get it. The first is set to occur on the 17th of Ramadan, which will only happen once and will never happen again. Whereas the second, according to the hadith of the Prophet, occurs in the last ten days of Ramadan, even more so on an odd night. This qadar night can occur every year, so we are always advised to get it with total preparation, namely by carrying out lots of sunnah worship in the last ten days of Ramadan. This verse also explains that fasting is obligatory in the month of Ramadan. To find out the beginning and end of the month of Ramadan Rasulullah saw has said: Fast because you see the moon (Ramadan) and open your fast, because you see the moon (Syawal), if it is closed for you, (in one) history says: If it is closed for you because of bad weather cloudy), then complete the month of Sha'ban thirty days (and in one Muslim history \"determine\" or count the month of Sha'ban thirty days). (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Regarding the situation of the closed month either due to weather conditions, or indeed because according to falakiyah calculations it cannot be seen on the 29th night of 30 Sha'ban, or on the 29th night of 30 Ramadan, the following provisions apply: Who who sees the month of Ramadan on the 29th in the night of the 30th month of Sha'ban, or there are people who see the moon, who can be trusted, then he is obliged to fast the next day. If there is no visible moon, then he must complete the month of Sha'ban 30 days. Likewise, whoever sees the month of Shawwal on the 29th night of the 30th of Ramadan, or someone who sees someone who can be trusted, then he must break his fast the next day. If he does not see the moon that night, then he must complete the 30 day fast. In the case of determining the start of the fasting day of Ramadan and the Shawwal holiday, this is to be entrusted to the government, so that if there are differences of opinion, they can be eliminated by a government decision, in accordance with the applicable rule: \"The government decision eliminates differences of opinion.\" People who cannot see the moon during Ramadan, such as residents who are in the north or south pole area where there are six months of night at the north pole and six months of day at the south pole, then the law is adjusted to the area where the revelation came down, namely Mecca where the area is considered mu'tadilah area (moderate or middle area) or reckoned to the place closest to the north pole and south pole. In verse 185, Allah strengthens verse 184, that even though fasting is obligatory, people who are sick and travelers are given leeway not to fast during Ramadan and replace it on other days. At the end of this verse, Allah emphasizes that fasting numbers be perfected and orders takbir and thanks to Allah for all the instructions given."

In the hadith, many things related to prayer are explained, including: 1. Words of the Prophet Muhammad: Three kinds of people are not denied their prayers, namely the just Imam, the one who is fasting until he breaks his fast and the prayer of someone who is being persecuted. (Muslim History) 2. Words of the Prophet Muhammad: \"Every servant's request is always accepted, as long as he does not pray for things that cause sin or break silaturrahim relations (and) as long as he does not ask for it to be granted immediately. The Messenger of Allah was asked, \"Does it mean to be granted immediately? Messenger of Allah?\" He replied, \"The point is a servant who said, \"I actually have prayed, but I see it has not been allowed, because of that he felt disappointed and did not pray anymore.\" (History of Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa'i and Ibnu Majah) Although there is an opinion that says that Allah swt is omnipotent, all-knowing and arranges everything, asked or not that opinion contradicts this verse and the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad. If some of the prayers offered to God have not been answered, then there are several reasons: a. They do not meet the proper conditions. b. God does not absolutely give what is requested by His servant, but is replaced or adapted to something better for the applicant, both in this world and in the hereafter. In this verse Allah connects the prayer that He promised to grant with the stipulation that His servants must obey His commandments and have faith in Him. In addition, prayer should be done fervently, earnestly and wholeheartedly, and not prayer to persecute people, break friendships and other immoral acts. Indeed, everything must be according to conditions or good procedures and be able to convey to what is meant. If someone says, \"O my Lord, give me a thousand rupiahs,\" without making any effort, then he is not praying but actually he is an ignorant person. This means that such a request is meaningless, because it is not accompanied by reasonable effort."

Many narrations tell about the reason for the revelation of this verse, including: at the beginning of the obligatory fast, the companions of the Prophet were allowed to eat, drink and have intercourse until Isha prayer or sleep. If they pray Isha or sleep, then wake up, then all of that is haram for them. At one time, 'Umar bin al-Khatthab had intercourse with his wife after the Isya prayer, and he was very sorry for what he had done and told the Messenger of Allah. So this verse came down explaining Allah's law which is lighter than what they already know and practice. That from sunset (maghrib) until before dawn (dawn), everything that is not permissible during the day in the month of Ramadan is permitted, with the following explanation: \"It is permissible for you during the night of Ramadan to have intercourse with your wives, because they are clothing for you and you are clothing for them. Allah knows that you have betrayed yourself, namely not being able to restrain your lust by fasting as you did, therefore Allah forgives you and gives you relief. So now interfere with them and seek what is prescribed for you \". (al-Baqarah\/2:186) This means that now you are allowed to have intercourse with your wife and do things that are permissible for you. Eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from the black thread, that is until dawn, complete your fast until night comes. Apart from that, you are also prohibited from having intercourse with your wife while you are praying in the mosque. Then Allah closes this verse by emphasizing that you cannot approach the prohibitions that Allah has prescribed and do not go beyond and violate them.

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah teaches the Prophet Muhammad to answer questions from friends about the use and wisdom of the \"month\" for mankind, namely for the purposes of calculating time in carrying out their religious affairs such as prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and so on as well as necessary world affairs. Allah explained the calculation of that time with the calculation of the lunar month, because it was easier than the calculation according to the circulation of the sun (syamsiah) and was more in accordance with the level of knowledge of the Arabs at that time. Scholars of interpretation explained that many of the Ansar, when they had entered ihram or hajj, they no longer wanted to enter the house from the usual door, but entered from the back door, and that was considered a virtue. This verse explains that virtue is not according to feelings and traditions that smell superstitious, such as entering a house from behind or from above, but virtue is fear of Allah, and it is ordained for them to enter the house from the door. According to scientists, the moon is a satellite of the earth which is about a quarter of the size of the earth. It circulates around the earth at an average distance of 384,400 kilometers under the pull of the earth's gravitational force. As a result of this circulation, the moon experiences phases and among them there are phenomena of the crescent moon, full moon, new moon and new moon. Everything happens because the positions of the moon and the earth shift regularly with respect to the position of the sun. When the moon is between the earth and the sun, its dark side faces the earth so that the moon is not visible to us on earth. This phase is called the new moon phase. Then it shifts from the new moon phase to the full moon phase and from the full moon phase to the new moon phase. In the dead moon phase, the moon will not appear again at all. While the crescent occurs between the new moon phase to the first half moon phase (first week, before the full moon) and between the second half moon phase (fourth week, after the full moon) to the new moon phase. From the new moon phase to the full moon phase, what happens is the crescent moon phase which looks like a thread that we can see in the western sky after sunset. Gradually the crescent widened until it became half. We call this phase of the moon the half moon phase. Then seven days after the half moon phase, we can see the full picture of the moon. We call this phase of the moon the full moon. Seven days later the appearance of the moon shrinks again so that it returns to the half moon phase. And so on until the moon again experiences a crescent phase which then eventually disappears. We call this phase the dead moon phase. So the crescent phase occurs 2 times a month, namely in the first week and the fourth week. The distance between the phases of the new moon to the next new moon or from the full moon to the next full moon is 29.5306 days which we call the synodic period. This is the basis for the calendar which is made using the lunar calendar system which we know as the lunar calendar. Most Wise Allah who has created the moon with extraordinary wisdom contained in it."

			"tafsir": "This verse is a Madaniyah verse which is one of the first verses which instructs Muslims to fight polytheists when Muslims receive a sudden attack, even though the attack occurs during the sacred months, namely in the months of Rajab, Zulkaidah, Zulhijah, and Muharam, as explained in the last verse. In the days of ignorance, these months were considered months of prohibition against war. This prohibition is recognized by Islam, but because the polytheists violated it first, Allah SWT allowed the Muslims to respond to their attacks. Before the migration, there was no verse that allowed Muslims to wage war. Among the commentators there was no disagreement that war was forbidden in Islam at that time. This verse up to verse 194, was revealed when the Hudaibiah peace was held, namely the peace agreement between the polytheists of Mecca and the Muslims of Medina. The agreement was held at one of the places on the road between Jeddah and Mecca. In the past, what was called Hudaibiah, was a well\/spring that was in that place. The incident occurred in the month of Zulkaidah in the sixth year of Hijri. Rasulullah saw with his companions left Medina for Mecca to perform Umrah. After the group arrived at Hudaibiah, they were blocked by polytheists and were not allowed to enter Mecca, so that the Prophet's group had to stay in Hudaibiah for up to one month. In the end, a peace treaty was held, the contents of which were as follows: a. The Prophet's entourage had to return to Medina that year. b. In the following year, namely the seventh year of Hijri, Rasulullah SAW and his companions were allowed to enter the city of Mecca, to perform Umrah. c. Among the polytheists and Muslims there will be no war for ten years. In the following year, Rasulullah returned to Mecca with his entourage to perform umrah, which is commonly called umrah qadha, because in the previous year they had not been able to do it. At that time the Muslims were worried that the polytheists would violate the peace agreement, while the Muslims did not like fighting in the Haram (Mecca) especially in the months of Shawwal, Zulkaidah, Zulhijah and Muharam, which are commonly called \"the forbidden months\". It was because of these circumstances and events that these verses were revealed. In verse 190, Allah orders the Muslims to fight the polytheists who fight them. The war should aim at fi sabilillah (to exalt Allah's sentence and uphold His religion). The war called \"fi sabilillah\" is as explained in a hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim: \"From Abu Musa al-Asy'ary, that the Messenger of Allah was once asked about a man who fought because of his courage and who fought because of illness. heart, or those who fight just because they want to get praise, which of them fights in the way of Allah? The Messenger of Allah replied, \"The one who fights to exalt the word of Allah, then his war is fi sabilillah.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim) In this holy book, believers are prohibited from violating various provisions, such as killing children, weak people who are helpless, people who are very old, women who have not participated in the war, people who have surrendered and priests, because Allah does not like those who person who crosses the line."

The meaning of slander here is the persecution by polytheists against Muslims by expulsion, torture, confiscation of property, and obstructing the implementation of worship and so on. If so, then the believers are ordered to respond with war as well. Such is the reward that must be given to the polytheists, but if the polytheists stop fighting and finally become believers, then they should not be disturbed, because the things that caused them to be fought are no longer there, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate and Most Merciful."

			"tafsir": "Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam. Hajj became obligatory for Muslims in the sixth year of Hijri. Previously, Rasulullah SAW had performed Hajj as a sunnah worship. Apart from Hajj, there is also Umrah. Both must be done by Muslims, once in a lifetime. Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage more than once, the law is sunnah. However, Imam Malik bin Anas is of the opinion that it is forbidden to perform Umrah twice a year. Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages do not have to be done immediately, they can be done if circumstances permit. Whoever is able to perform the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages should immediately perform them. The only place to perform the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages is in the holy land of Mecca and its surroundings. Those who are obliged to go for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages are those who are able and able, that is, sufficient funds are available, their physical condition permits and their security is not compromised. The difference between Hajj and Umrah is that Hajj has five pillars, namely: intention, standing, thawaf, sa'i, and tahallul, while Umrah has only four pillars: intention, thawaf, sa'i, and tahallul. Some of the deeds in the pilgrimage are pillars, some are obligatory and some are sunnah. Deeds that are pillars are if something is left out then the pilgrimage and Umrah are invalid. Deeds that are obligatory are if someone is left out, then a fine is imposed (dam) but Hajj and Umrah are valid. Charities that are sunnah, if someone is left out, then Hajj and Umrah are valid and are not subject to dam. In addition, there are restrictions for people who are performing Hajj and Umrah. These prohibitions are usually called muharramat. Whoever violates muharramat, is subject to dam. The size of the muharramat is commensurate with the size of the violated muharramat. Having intercourse before completing the tawaf ifadhah invalidates Hajj and Umrah. The Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages have several legal aspects. Therefore, whoever is going to practice worship should first study it. These practices are commonly called manasik. This verse 196 was revealed when the Hudaibiah peace was held in the 6th year of Hijri, the same as verse 190 regarding permission to fight for Muslims. This verse was revealed in connection with the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimage where Muslims are required to perform Hajj and Umrah. What is meant by Allah's order to \"perfect\" Hajj and Umrah, is to do it perfectly and sincerely because Allah swt. There is a possibility that someone who has intended to perform Hajj and Umrah will be hindered by various obstacles to complete it. In this case, Allah SWT provides the following provisions: a person who has entered ihram for Hajj and Umrah and then is prevented by the enemy so that his Hajj and Umrah cannot be completed, then that person must provide a camel, cow or goat to be slaughtered. It is permissible for the animals to be slaughtered, after arriving in Mecca, and ending their ihram by (shaving or cutting their hair). Regarding the place of slaughter, there are differences of opinion, some are obligatory in the Holy Land of Mecca, some are permitted outside the Holy Land of Mecca. If you don't find an animal to be slaughtered, then that animal can be replaced with food worth that animal and given to the poor. If you are unable to give food in charity, then it is replaced by fasting, each mud of food is equal to one day of fasting. People who have entered ihram for Hajj or Umrah, then he is sick or has a disease on his head such as boils, and he considers his suffering lighter if he shaves his head, he is allowed to shave but must pay fidyah by fasting 3 days or giving alms of food as much as 3 sa' (10, 5 liters) to the poor, or fidyah with a goat."

It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas and has been valid in the schools of Abu Hanifah, Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad, that the time for performing the pilgrimage is in the month of Shawwal, Zulkaidah until dawn on the night of the 10th of Zulhijah. The provisions of the time of this pilgrimage have been in effect since the Prophet Abraham and Prophet Ismail. After the Islamic religion came, these provisions were not changed, instead they were continued as they were. People who are performing Hajj are prohibited from having intercourse, saying vile words, violating religious prohibitions, making fun of, boasting, quarreling, and making enemies. All attention is devoted to doing good solely. Hearts and minds are only devoted to worship, seeking the pleasure of Allah and always remembering Him. Whatever good is done by a Muslim who has performed Hajj, surely Allah will know and record it and will be rewarded with multiple rewards. In order for the pilgrimage to be carried out properly and perfectly, everyone must bring sufficient provisions, especially food, drink, clothing and others, namely provisions for traveling and performing Hajj in the holy land and provisions to return to their respective places. -respectively. It was narrated by al-Bukhari, Abu Daud, an-Nasa'i, and others from Ibn 'Abbas that he said, \"There are among the people of Yemen, when they go on a pilgrimage they don't bring enough supplies, they just have to put their trust in Allah. Allah. After they arrived at the holy land, they ended up begging because they ran out of supplies.\" So the best provision is to be pious, and should bring sufficient provisions so that you don't end up begging and living in poverty. Allah reminds, that the pilgrimage should be done with full piety to Allah by doing everything that He has commanded and leaving everything that He has forbidden. That way happiness and luck will be achieved which is full of pleasure and divine grace."

This verse was revealed in connection with the doubts of Muslims at the beginning of the arrival of Islam to try to earn sustenance, so that many of them closed their shops during the pilgrimage season, for fear of sinning. Narrated by al-Bukhari from Ibn 'Abbas, he said, \"In the time of ignorance there were 3 markets, namely Ukaz, Majannah, and Zulmajaz.\" During the pilgrimage season, the Muslims felt it was a sin to trade in these markets, so they asked the Messenger of Allah, so this verse was revealed. Trying to find halal sustenance while performing Hajj is permissible as long as the business is carried out on the side, not as a goal. The main goal is to perform the pilgrimage with full piety to Allah and with a sincere heart. Then in this verse Allah commands everyone who performs the pilgrimage to make remembrance of Allah when they have departed from Padang Arafah to Muzdalifah, that is when they have arrived at Masy'aril Haram. Masy'aril Haram is a hill in Muzdalifah named Quzah. When you have arrived at that place, you should read more prayers, takbir, and talbiyah.

Strictly speaking, there is no difference during the period of performing Hajj, all of them are creatures of Allah, and they must perform wuquf together at Arafah.

What is good is that after completing the pilgrimage, they repeat the name of Allah as they used to mention the names of their ancestors, or try to chant the name of Allah more. In the sermon, the Prophet Muhammad, while performing the pilgrimage wada' on the second day of the tasyrik days, gave a stern warning to leave the old ways, that is, to boast about the strengths of their respective ancestors. The Prophet, among other things, said, \"O people, know that your God is one and your ancestor is one (Adam).\" \"Know that there is no advantage for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor is there an advantage for a non-Arab over an Arab. There is no advantage for a red person over a black person and a black person over a red person. Their advantage in the sight of Allah is only measured by their piety to Allah. Then Rasulullah asked them, \"Have I conveyed this warning?\" Then the audience replied, \"Yes, the Messenger of Allah has conveyed.\" Then Allah divides the levels of people who perform the pilgrimage, that is, there are people who only benefit from this world only, and do not benefit from it in the hereafter; namely people whose attention is only focused on seeking worldly benefits, either in their prayers or in their remembrance. In praying he only asked for splendor, glory, victory, and possessions. The calculation is only worldly profit and loss. People who are like this are because they have not yet reached the knowledge of the secrets and the true nature of Hajj, their hearts have not received the light of guidance from Allah.

			"tafsir": "After the pilgrims are in Mina, returning from Arafah, Allah once again warns them to recite the remembrance of Allah, namely to recite takbir on certain days, namely on tasyrik days (11,12,13 Zulhijah) by abandoning the customs of the ignorant era, that is, on those days they hold large meetings to boast, highlight the merits of their ancestors, and other things that each is proud of. For this reason, when the Prophet Muhammad finished performing the Hajj pilgrimage, he gave a sermon at Mina, as mentioned above. Allah ordered that the pilgrims recite the remembrance of Allah on certain days. Jumhur scholars are of the opinion that what is meant by certain days, namely three days after the Hajj feast, the 11th, 12th and 13th of the month of Zulhijah. The meaning of dhikr in this verse is takbir and it is performed after each fardu prayer and every time stoning the jumrah. And the pronunciation of the takbir is as follows: Allah is Great; Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest; There is no God but Allah. Allah is the Greatest; Allah is the Greatest; And all praise is for Allah. The takbir after the Asar prayer on the third day of tasyrik is the last takbir in the framework of carrying out the takbir order mentioned in this verse. Pilgrims who are in Mina two days after the pilgrimage holiday, may immediately return to Mecca. They were in Mina for stoning. Therefore pilgrims are obliged to spend the night in Mina only on the first and second nights of the tashrik days. They may also return to Mecca later, so they will be in Mina for three days, namely on the 11th, 12th and 13th of Zulhijah. Whichever of these two things they choose and do, there is no sin on them, even if those who return later (3 days in Mina) are more afdal. This stipulation is an affirmation from Allah swt to dispel the standpoint of ignorant people who some think that those who return to Mecca immediately sin, and some think that those who return late to Mecca are the ones who sin. Those who hasten to return to Mecca (two days after the holiday) are called early nafar (first group), while delaying until the third day is called nafar sani (second group). For the initial nafar, they must leave Mina on the second day of tasyrik, after throwing the jumrah and after noon before sunset. If by the time the sun sets, they have not left Mina for some reason, then their initial vows will be canceled and they will have to spend the night again and only be able to leave Mina after performing the jumrah on the third day of tasyrik after noon. The flexibility and opportunity to choose is given by Allah to the pilgrims because these two things can be carried out with full piety to Allah SWT. For those who hasten because they are afraid to commit violations such as killing forbidden animals, sleeping with his wife (copulation), and things that are still prohibited after the first tahalul before the second tahalul, and for those who delay, it is because they want to do what is afdal and believe that he is able to stay away from all these prohibitions. Because of the importance of piety and to establish that piety in the heart, Allah SWT emphasized once again with his words: ... And fear Allah,... (al-Baqarah\/2: 203) Then followed by words that can strengthen heart to fear taqwa, namely: ... And know that you will be gathered to Him¦. (al-Baqarah\/2: 203) Someone who knows and believes that he will be collected in the next day and is accountable for all his deeds in the world, will certainly do more good and increase his piety to Allah swt"

They fight in the way of Allah; so they kill or be killed, (as) a true promise from Allah in the Torah, Bible and Al-Qur'an. And who is more true to his promise than Allah? So be happy with the buying and selling that you have done, and that is a great victory. (at-Taubah\/9: 111)."

Imam Fakhrur Razi said, \"There is nothing wrong if it is said that this verse was revealed for the three groups.\" It has become an inherent character, especially in the hearts of unbelievers, namely to love the world more than anything. Satan describes to them the pleasures of living in a beautiful world as profusely as possible until all their attention is devoted to the world. They took it desperately, defended it with body and soul, regardless of religious prohibitions, decency or the laws of Allah and the Messenger. Many of their reproaches were aimed at believers, such as Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Ammar bin Yasir, Suhaib, and so on, deliberately to humiliate and humiliate them. They said, \"Muslims like to torture themselves and leave the pleasures of the world, they work hard to do worship, restrain their lust by fasting, give alms, and pay large fees for pilgrimage, and so on.

People who fear Allah will be admitted to heaven, as mentioned in the words of Allah SWT: This is the paradise that We will inherit to Our servants who are always pious. .(Maryam\/19: 63). Unbelievers are proud of the worldly pleasures they have, the accumulated wealth they have earned, and they insult the believers who are generally poor, not many who are richer than them. To answer this insult, Allah closes this verse with one affirmation that their suspicions were not true.God gives sustenance in this world to whom whatever He wants, whether he is a disbeliever or a believer, the difference is only if he is an infidel, his sustenance is \"istidraj\", that is, plunges them gradually into the painful torments that will be encountered. The torment and punishment they will receive in the next day is because they do not want to be conscious and do not want to return to the path of Allah, even if they are happy and self-sufficient. As for the believer, his sustenance is a \"slander\" that is a trial, is he able and able to use and utilize it for things that are pleasing to Allah SWT or not?

One creed and one goal of charity, namely to improve and not to destroy, to do good and not to do evil, to do justice and not to do wrong, then they turn and do the opposite, and there is no unity of faith and opinion between them, which brought them to happiness, then they clashed, divided. To return them to their original state, united in truth, Allah sent prophets, chosen people, to guide them to the right path, to give instructions for the mistakes they had made, to convey good news to those who believe and obey. The prophets who were sent were equipped with heavenly books which were revealed to them, which contained all the truth, complete instructions and explanations, which would be used as a basis for giving consideration and making the fairest possible decision on everything that was in dispute. In fact, humans no longer need to argue because the given divine book contains real information, all of which are known and understood. So what is it that causes them to blame each other and think that only he is right and the others are wrong. This is due to the nature of envy and likes to commit offenses. If this jealous nature has been instilled in the heart, both individually and as a group, it will be difficult to obtain peace and prosperity among them. Lucky are those who believe, because by the will of Allah swt they have been guided to the right path. Aisyah ra said, \"Indeed, when the Messenger of Allah wakes up in the middle of the night, he does \"shalah al-Lail\" (night prayer), and he prays: \"O Allah, Lord Gabriel, Mikail, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, who knows the supernatural and the real. You are the one who gives judgment between Your servants about what they dispute. Give me the correct instructions about what is in dispute with Your permission. Verily, it is You who guides those whom You will to the straight path. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) In one of the ma'sur (practiced) prayers of the friends there is a saying as follows: O Allah, show us what is right is right, then guide us to follow it, and show us what is wrong is wrong, and guide us to avoid it. Do not make right and wrong obscure to us, which will lead us astray. And make us leaders for the pious people.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)."

First, the opinion of Qatadah, as-Suddi, and most of the commentators who say that this verse was revealed during the Khandak war when the Muslims experienced various difficulties and emotional pressure, so they felt trembling and afraid. Second, another opinion says that this verse was revealed at the time of the Uhud war, when the Muslims were beaten back by enemy troops. In that battle, Sayyidina Hamza was killed, beaten, and the Prophet was injured. Third, the opinion of other groups, that this verse was revealed to comfort the hearts of the Muhajirin when they left their hometown, and their wealth was controlled by the polytheists, and the Jews showed open hostility to the Prophet Muhammad and other difficulties he experienced in Medina. . This verse indirectly strengthens the previous verses, namely that Muslims are always steadfast and patient in the struggle. Allah swt says: And We will definitely test you with a little fear, hunger, lack of wealth, soul and fruits. And give good tidings to those who are patient, (al-Baqarah\/2: 155) and His words: Do people think that they will be left alone by saying, \"We have believed,\" and they will not be tested? (al-'Ankabut\/29: 2) The heavier and higher the goals that will be achieved, the greater the obstacles and trials that will be experienced. To achieve the pleasure of Allah and obtain heaven, is not an easy and easy thing, but must go through a persistent struggle which is full of obstacles and trials just like the previous people. They were struck by calamity and tribulation, their prophets were killed, their followers were tortured until some of them were sawed off while their heads were alive or burned alive. Because the trials and suffering they experienced were felt for a long time, even though they were sure that somehow Allah's help would come, their apostle and his followers felt anxious and said, \"When Allah's help comes,\" the question was answered by Allah, \"Remember, indeed Allah's help is very close.\" In time they will triumph and defeat their enemies, persecutors and unjust people."

The livelihood referred to in this verse is sunnah maintenance, namely alms, not obligatory maintenance such as zakat and others. This verse teaches that whatever is spent, whether a lot or a little, is for the person who spends it and is recorded by Allah SWT as a good deed, as explained in one hadith which reads: \"The reward for your deeds is yours. I am the one who recorded it for you.\" (Muslim history from Abu dzarr al-Giffari). Something that is spent should be given first to parents, namely parents, because both of them are the people who are most meritorious to their children. It was they who educated him from the womb, and at a young age took great pains to maintain his growth. After that, maintenance is given to relatives, such as children, relatives who need help. They are the people who should be helped, because if left alone, they will end up asking other people, the result will be embarrassing to the family, then to orphans who have not been able to try to meet their needs. Finally, to the poor and those who are on their way to cover their needs, lighten the burden because even though they are not related, they are members of the extended Muslim family, who should be helped when they are in trouble.

While still in Mecca (before the Hijrah) the Prophet Muhammad was prohibited from fighting, only at the beginning of the year of the Hijrah, the Prophet was allowed to fight when necessary. Fighting war is felt as a heavy order for Muslims because it will consume wealth and lives. Especially at the beginning of the Hijrah to Medina. The Muslims are still few, while the polytheists have a large number. Fighting at that time felt very heavy, but because the order to fight had come to defend the sanctity of the Islamic religion and exalt the sentence of Allah, Allah explained that not everything that is felt as heavy and difficult brings suffering, but hopefully it will bring good. How worried is a patient whose treatment must be by undergoing surgery, while surgery is the most hated and feared, but for the sake of his health he must obey the doctor's advice, then the disease will disappear and the body will become healthy after the operation.

When people asked the Messenger of Allah, what was the ruling on fighting in the Haram months, as Abdullah bin Jahsy had done with the Quraysh merchant group, a revelation came down stating that it was unlawful to fight in those months and the sins were great. But blocking people from the way of Allah, is an act of disbelief in Allah. While blocking the Muslims from entering the Grand Mosque, expelling Muslims from Mecca, is an even greater sin in the sight of Allah. All of that is slander that is more dangerous than killing in the Haram month. The slander in this verse includes all the serious violations as mentioned above and persecutes and tortures Muslims. Such an act is more sinful than fighting. As was the case with the infidels of Quraysh against Ammar bin Yasir, Bilal, Habbab bin Arat and others. Ammar bin Yasir was tortured with hot iron attached to his body, so that he would quit Islam. But he remained in Islam. He was not the only one who was tortured, also his father, mother and brother. Bilal was also tortured by his employer, Umayyah bin Khalaf. Bilal was not allowed to eat and drink day and night with his hands and feet bound, thrown into the middle of a scorching desert, a large stone was placed on his back, then Umayyad tortured him saying, \"You will continue to suffer this punishment until you die. if you do not want to leave Islam and return to worshiping the god \"Lata and Uzza\". But Bilal would rather suffer punishment and torment than deny Allah and Muhammad. Many of the followers of the Prophet Muhammad saw the same fate as Ammar bin Yasir and Bilal. This cruel way will continue to be carried out by unbelievers against Muslims at all times and places, wherever they have the opportunity, so that Muslims become apostates from their religion. Apostasy means leaving the religion of Islam. they die in a state of apostasy, all their deeds will be erased and they will be eternally in hell."

			"tafsir": "This verse answers the questions the Companions put to the Prophet Muhammad. These answers are not only regarding the law of alcohol and gambling, but at the same time answer questions about what will be a living; and also on the issue of orphans. The ban on drinking khamr was gradually reduced. Because drinking khamr for the Arabs has become an ingrained custom since the time of ignorance. If banned all at once, it is feared that it will be very burdensome for them. At first it was said that the sin was great, then it was said that drunk people could not pray; and finally it is said that drinking khamr is abominable and includes the devil's work. Then they are reproached by saying, \"Aren't you going to stop drinking it yet?\" Strictly speaking: drinking khamr and playing gambling is prohibited, and unlawful. What is meant by khamr in the opinion of the majority of scholars are all intoxicating drinks, even if they are made from whatever ingredients. So drinking anything that is intoxicating, the law is unlawful, whether a little or a lot. All health experts agree, both past and present, that drinking khamr is very dangerous. God will not forbid something, if it is not harmful to humans. There is no doubt that drinking khamr is harmful to health, mind and nerves, as well as property and family. Drinking khamr is the same as smoking opium, narcotics and illegal drugs (drugs) which are addictive. Someone who has been addicted to drinking khamr, for him there is no value in property, whatever the price of the khamr he will buy it. Thus, khamr is harmful to society, causing hostility, fights, and so on. Households will be chaotic, neighbors will be insecure and society will be damaged because of drinking khamr. Alcohol addiction disease is very closely related to all immoral acts and crimes. A person who is already drunk will not be ashamed to commit adultery in immoral places such as night clubs, bars and so on. The two obscene acts are usually placed together. The danger of drinking khamar will be even greater if it is mixed with adultery. Not only squandering wealth and indulging in lust, but all kinds of venereal diseases will spread, children without legal fathers will be born, and innocent babies will be killed. Work like this is a cursed act that is inhumane, an abomination that is more heinous than that of an animal. As with drinking khamr, Allah also forbids gambling because the dangers are greater than the benefits. Gambling is all games that use bets, the loser must pay the winner. The bet is anything: money, goods, and so on. The dangers of playing gambling are no less than the dangers of drinking khamr. Gambling very quickly generates hostility and anger, and not infrequently leads to murder. The danger has been proven since long ago until now. Whenever gambling has spread in a place, there will always be strife, hostility and murder in that place. Reckless work, often happens to gambling players, such as suicide, robbery, etc., especially when he loses. Gambling is a dangerous act, as a result of gambling a good person can become evil, lazy to do worship, and get bored from remembering Allah. He became lazy, angry, his eyes were red, and his body was limp. By itself his morals become corrupted, he doesn't want to work to earn his sustenance in a good way, and he always hopes for victory. In the history of gambling, no one has become rich because of gambling. In fact, the opposite happened, many rich people suddenly fell into poverty and were destitute because of gambling. Many happy households suddenly fall apart because of gambling. As for the benefits of drinking khamr, they are very few, they are practically insignificant compared to the harms. For example, khamar, maybe it can be used as a medicine, it can be used as a profitable trading commodity, and it can raise enthusiasm for soldiers who are going to war, and so on. But all that is not a significant benefit. Regarding the dangers of drinking khamr and playing gambling, and what will be suffered by intoxicants and gambling players in the future, besides being explained by Allah in the Qur'an, it is also explained in many hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad. After the friends asked about the two problems that were very dangerous, namely drinking intoxicants and playing gambling, they asked what problems they would make a living for. In one history, from Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn 'Abbas, some of the Prophet's companions came to ask him, \"We don't know yet, is that fi sabilillah income that we were ordered to take out from our property?\" This verse is the answer. Allah SWT deliberately combines the problem of living with the problem of intoxicants and gambling in one verse, to be a mirror of comparison for humans, that besides there are people who squander their wealth to do immoral acts such as drinking intoxicants and gambling, there are also people who use their wealth to earn a living. God's way. Those who squander their wealth in the way of immorality will get destruction and calamity, whereas those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah will get happiness and luck. What is meant by maintenance in this verse is giving alms, charity, charity, donations, and other things which are voluntary, while zakat is obligatory. This has been explained in other verses. The meaning of al-'afwa here is \"that which is more than necessary\". So what will be spent is wealth that is already in excess of basic daily needs. Allah recommends that a person try to find sustenance for the needs of his children and wife and those who are under his responsibility. But if the sustenance given by Allah is more than what is needed, Allah recommends that he spend it, that is, give some of the excess wealth for fi sabilillah needs. For example to build houses of worship, such as mosques, prayer rooms or surau, or to build orphanages or educational houses such as madrasas, student dormitories, the poor, also students and students in the form of scholarships, and so on. other. Social charities as mentioned above, can be financed by the maintenance provided by the Muslims. Providing a living in this case is very important, because it is the lifeblood of development in Islam and is a bridge that connects the rich and the poor. That's how Allah provides guidance with His verses for the happiness of mankind. He shows which way can bring benefit and goodness and the way that will plunge into danger and destruction. In this case, humans should think about it. Think not only for the world but also think about the afterlife in every effort and work. Muslims will be victorious and noble if they want to use their minds to think about the safety of their lives and their people in this world and in the hereafter. In the world, they become people who are honorable and respected, because they are people who are capable, authoritative, and hold the reins of power. In the afterlife, he becomes a lucky person because of his many good deeds."

Questions arose regarding these orphans during the time of the Prophet Muhammad from people who had lived with orphans, mixed their wealth with theirs, and ate and drank together in one house. In this way, the orphans are looked after, both food and well-being, but then this verse was revealed: Verily, those who unjustly eat the property of orphans, in fact they swallow the fire in their stomachs and they will enter into the burning fire. flame (hell). (an-Nisa'\/4: 10) With the revelation of that verse, they doubted if their actions towards orphans had been unjust, including consuming the orphan's property. Verse 220 explains that the main thing in this matter is the good care of orphans, so that their lives are not wasted. Do not let them be abandoned and not guaranteed peace and prosperity. All kinds of maintenance and care for orphans is kindness. If they were brought to live in the same house, that would also be good, because living together is already a life of brothers. It's as if the orphans were little siblings, their health is cared for like caring for siblings, or their own biological children. So it is permissible to mix the assets of orphans with the assets of those who care for them, as long as there is an intention for their safety and not to harm them. Regarding a person's intentions and what is stored in his heart, only Allah knows, because Allah knows best who is good and who is evil. It happens a lot, people say they have good intentions to care for orphans, but in reality they abuse and torture them. In caring for orphans, it depends on the ability of those who care for them, but the main thing is ensuring the safety of these orphans, and not letting them be wasted, both regarding their needs for food and drink, clothing and shelter, as well as their education and health, especially more about his property, if any. It must be maintained as best as possible. If the orphans are wasted, surely this will cause the wrath of Allah swt. Verily, He is Mighty, Most Wise in managing the benefit of His servants."

Even though they are beautiful and handsome, dashing, rich, and so on, believing slave girls or boys are better off to marry than them. From the side of women who believe, there are not a few who are beautiful, attractive, and have good character. In a hadith, Rasulullah SAW said: Don't marry women because of their beauty, maybe that beauty will destroy them, don't marry them because of their wealth, maybe that wealth will cause them to be rebellious and stubborn. But marry them because of their religion (faith and morals). Black, but religious, slave girls are better than those mentioned above. (History of Ibn Majah from Abdullah bin 'Umar). In another hadith, Rasulullah saw said: A woman is married for four reasons, namely: because of her wealth, because of her offspring, because of her beauty and because of her religion. Choose a religious woman, then you will be lucky. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) Marriage is closely related to religion. Mushrik people are not religious people, they worship other than Allah. In the matter of marrying polytheists there is a strong prohibition limit, but in matters of association, socializing is normal. Because marriage is closely related to heredity and descent is closely related to inheritance, eating and drinking, and has something to do with Islamic education and development. Marriage with polytheists is considered dangerous as explained above, so Allah forbids having marital relations with them.

			"tafsir": "In this verse, it is explained about menstruation and attitudes towards women who are menstruating. Menstrual blood is weak egg cells due to not being fertilized that come out of a woman's uterus every month, at the earliest one day and one night, and usually 6 or 7 days, and a maximum of 15 days. Various attitudes of the ancients towards menstruating women. The Jews were very strict in their attitudes, they did not want to associate with their menstruating wives, they did not want to eat and drink together, they did not want to share the house with them, and they did not want to touch menstruating women because their skin was considered unclean. Christians have a different attitude, they socialize normally with menstruating women, there is no difference between those who are menstruating and those who are not menstruating. They associate freely and do as they please. The Arabs in the time of ignorance had the same attitude as the Jews. Islam forbids a husband from having sex with his wife who is menstruating. Health experts have explained a lot about the dangers of having sex with menstruating women. The end of the verse explains that Allah loves people who want to repent of their mistakes, and to people who always maintain cleanliness. Menstruation in adult women occurs when the unfertilized ovary is expelled from the body. Because fertilization does not occur, the uterine wall, which was previously ready to receive fertilization, will contract. With this contraction, the ovary that is not fertilized will be thrown out along with the blood that is released from the broken hair vein. After the eggs and blood leave the body will repeat the process of maturation of the ovaries. All these processes are repeated continuously over a period of time. Every month, new ovaries are formed, the same hormones are released, all at the same time. Thus, women have a certain time when they are truly ready to be fertilized. If fertilization occurs, the menstrual pattern that rotates continuously will change. The occurrence of \"emptiness\" in the uterus can only be known by examining the anatomy of the uterus using sophisticated equipment. However, it turns out that this change, which only modern science can reveal, has been revealed in the Qur'an, which means this: \"Allah knows what every woman contains, what is imperfect and what is growing in the womb. And everything anything has a measure in His side.\" (ar-Ra'd\/13: 8) The verse above talks about the occurrence of menstruation. The translation of the verse is not able to show the process of menstruation properly. However, the English translation seems to better express this process, thus: \"Allah knows what every female bears and every shrinking of the womb and every swelling. Everything has its measure with Him\". (ar-Ra'd\/13: 8) At the beginning of menstruation, the layer of mucus (mucus) that lines the uterine wall (endometrial lining) is 0.5 mm thick. Under the influence of hormones secreted by the ovaries, this layer will thicken to 5-6 mm. This layer is then discarded when the egg is not fertilized. As can be seen from the verse above, the thickening and sloughing of the lining in the uterine wall is expressed by the translation \"shrinking\" and swelling."

For this reason, Allah commands to do good deeds, as a preparation for the future so that we can get pious offspring, be useful for religion and nation, and be devoted to both parents.

When a seed is put into fertile soil like that, it immediately germinates, grows well too. These sprouts grow with the energy they get from the soil's nutrients. It is clear that the soil used for farming is a fertile medium for the growth of seeds into new plants. In the verse above, it is explained that \"your wives are (like) the land where you cultivate\". This is indeed the case, because the uterus that exists in every woman is a fertile medium for conception to occur between the sperm (male seed) and the egg cell, which is contained in the woman's uterus. This conception event will soon be followed by growth into a fetus, assisted by 'food in the form of nutrients or vitamins contained in the mother's womb. Even the mother's mitochondria, will provide energy supply in the process of growing the fetus into a baby. So it is appropriate in the parable above, that wives are fields or land for farming."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, the law of divorce is explained as a refinement of the laws mentioned in the previous verses. If a wife who is menstruating is divorced by her husband, then she should be patient and wait three times to recite the quru' before she can marry another man. Three times quru' are three times sacred in the opinion of the majority of scholars). This is called the Idah period, which is the period of having to wait. As long as she is still in the period of Idah, she cannot hide what has happened in her womb, whether she is pregnant or is menstruating again. Every wife who believes in Allah and the Last Day, she must be honest, admit frankly what has happened in her womb. During the Jahiliyya period, dishonest wives often did not say that they were pregnant. After her Idah expired, she married another man, so not long after the marriage, her child was born. Disputes and fights occurred between the husband and wife. If the ex-husband does not admit that it is his child, then the innocent baby will be abused, because the mother was dishonest when she was still in her Idah period. There was also something that happened at that time, the wife did not want to be honest that her Idah had run out, she said she was still in her period, meaning she lied, so that her husband would continue to give her groceries as long as she was in Idah, then this verse was revealed prohibiting a divorced wife from hiding what happened in her womb. As long as the woman who is divorced is still in her Idah, the husband may reconcile, that is what is better if the intention of the reconciliation is to rebuild a good household. This beautiful time is enough for the husband to think about whether he will reconcile (especially since he already has children) or if he will divorce. But if reconciliation is not driven by good intentions, namely only to take revenge, or to trouble and hurt the wife, then this kind of act is prohibited by Allah and it is an unjust act against women. Divorces handed down to wives like this are called raj'i divorces, namely divorces that can still be reconciled before the expiry of the waiting period. Then the word of Allah which says that women have equal rights with men and men have one level advantage over their wives, is the argument that in good deeds they achieve progress in all aspects of life, especially in the field of science, women and men equally have rights and obligations. Even so, the rights and obligations are adjusted to their nature, both physically and mentally. For example, a wife has the obligation to take care of the household, educate children and maintain their health, keep the cleanliness and secrets of the household and so on. While the husband as the head of the family works and tries to earn a lawful living to support his wife and children. In the family\/household, husband and wife are equal partners, helping each other and helping each other in creating a sakinah household that pleases Allah SWT. The differences that exist are for complementarity and cooperation, not as something contradictory in building a happy household. Although supporting the family is the husband's obligation, it does not mean that the wife cannot help support the family, but if the wife pays for household expenses\/a living, that is only tabarru', not an obligation. If the husband falls into poverty, due to termination of employment (PHK) or illness which makes him unable to provide a living, then the wife is obliged to help with household expenses, but if the husband is capable of providing a living, then he is obliged to reimburse the expenses incurred by the wife, unless If the wife is willing not to be replaced, then the living she has spent becomes voluntary assistance to the household. In society, women may compete with men to seek progress and do good deeds. If someone accuses that Islam does not give basic freedom to women, that is an accusation that is not true. It was Islam that first raised the status of women as high as possible, before today's advanced world was able to do so. It has been 14 centuries since Islam gave rights and obligations to women and men, while the other world at that time was still in complete darkness. A husband as the head of the household is responsible for the welfare and safety of the household by providing household expenses which are obtained in a lawful way. Thus Allah arranges husband and wife relationships in harmonious ways to achieve happiness in married life."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains that raj'i divorce only applies twice. If the divorce has been three times, it cannot be reconciled again and it is called divorce ba'in. Scholars are of the opinion that a person who divorces three times at once, then his divorce is counted three, but there are also scholars who argue that divorce is one. During the time of ignorance, the Arabs imposed divorce according to their will and were not limited, then they reconciled at will too. Jobs like that make fun of women and humiliate them, even though they are servants of Allah who must be respected and glorified, just like men. So the revelation of this verse is to change and improve this bad situation, to arrange marriage affairs, divorce and reconciliation as well as possible. As long as he is still in one or two divorces, the husband may reconcile in a good way, or still divorce in a good way too. What is meant by good is that as long as she is married, the woman still gets money for shopping, she is still allowed to live in her husband's house, then the distribution of divorce assets is also carried out in a good way, so that the woman has been given her rights according to what she should have. If he is truly divorced, the husband may not take back what has been given to his wife, such as dowry and other things, on the contrary, the dowry is added to gifts so that his life is guaranteed after the divorce. If a husband and wife are worried that they will not be able to carry out God's provisions, if this is caused by the husband, then he is not justified in taking back what has been given to his wife. But if this is caused by the wife out of hatred for her husband or fear that he will not be fair to her, the wife may give back the property that her husband has given her to free herself from the marriage bond, so that her husband wants to divorce her, and the husband is not sinful to take back his gift. . The act of a wife like this, namely being willing to give part of her wealth to her husband as long as they can be divorced, is called khulu'. It was narrated by al-Bukhari, Ibn Majah and an-Nasa'i' from Ibn 'Abbas that a woman named Jamilah, sister of 'Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, wife of Sabit bin Qais came to the Messenger of Allah and said, \"O Messenger of Allah, my husband is Sabit I will no longer obey bin Qais because I am angry at his bad behavior, I am afraid that I will become an infidel again because of my betrayal and disobedience to my husband.\" The Messenger of Allah asked, \"Are you willing to give back the garden that your husband gave you as a dowry first and thus you will divorce him?\" Jamilah replied, \"I am willing to return it as long as I am divorced, O Messenger of Allah.\" So the Messenger of Allah said, \"O Sabit, take back your garden and divorce her again.\" Giving back voluntarily the garden that is already his, as long as he is divorced, that's called self-redemption and the word garden is kuniyah of dowry. Divorce is called khulu', may not be reconciled except with a new contract and dowry, and the ransom is called 'iwadh. These provisions are God's decrees that govern household life which cannot be violated, so that a happy household is realized. So whoever disobeys them, they are the wrongdoers."

This verse tells us to be careful in divorcing divorce, not to be rash and not to be impetuous. Think it over carefully, because of your haste in dropping divorce, you'll end up regretting it. Divorce is permissible in Islam, but it is an act that Allah hates. The consequences of divorce are enormous, both for the husband, especially for the wife and children. Therefore, if you are still in the second divorce, it is better to reconcile, if indeed you can still hope for the realization of a happy household, and can carry out God's commands as well as possible."

			"tafsir": "This verse describes the method that must be followed by a husband who has divorced his wife as an explanation of the previous verses. As for the reason for the revelation of this verse, there are two narrations. First, Ibn Jarir narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that during the time of the Prophet Muhammad there was a man who divorced his wife, then before his wife's period of waiting expired, he referred her back. After that he dropped the divorce again and then reconciled. This was done to hurt and abuse his wife, so the verse above was revealed. The second history was narrated by as-Suddi that this verse was revealed regarding the actions of a friend from the Ansar group, namely Sickle bin Yasar who had divorced his wife. After his wife's iddah period is only two or three days, he refers to her, then divorces again with the aim of causing trouble to his wife, so this verse is revealed, prohibiting this act. If a husband has divorced his wife, then when his wife's period of iddah is almost over, he should choose one of two options, namely reconciliation or divorce in an amicable way. With the end of Idah, the husband and wife's marriage is broken, and the ex-wife is free to choose another mate. Furthermore, this verse prohibits a husband from making reference to his wife with the aim of causing harm and abuse. In addition to Allah's prohibition, it describes the behavior of society during the ignorance period where the husband imposed divorce on his wife without a certain limit and every time he was nearing the end of the iddah period, the husband reconciled and so on. It is also an explanation of the actions of Sabit bin Yasar's friend which has been described in terms of the reason for the revelation of this verse. A husband who does this is abusing himself, an act that can create enmity with his wife's family relatives and is also hated by society, and in the end he will not escape God's wrath. In this verse, Allah forbids humans from playing with His laws, including the laws governing husband and wife relationships to bring people to live happily in this world and in the hereafter. These provisions are a blessing from Allah that must be remembered and practiced as a sign of gratitude to Him. There is no scholarly dispute within the four schools of thought regarding the legality of divorce handed down by the husband in a playful way (not really). This is in line with the words of Rasulullah SAW: There are three problems, if it is done in earnest, then it will happen seriously, and if it is done in a playful way, then it will happen seriously, namely: marriage, divorce and refer. (Al-Arba'ah history except for an-Nasa'i from Abu Hurairah) Having sex with a wife who is still in idah raj'i is illegal according to the Shafi'i school of thought, because the validity of reconciliation is by saying (pronunciation). Meanwhile, according to the Hanafi and Hanbali schools of thought, intercourse is considered to be reconciled even without pronunciation (speech)."

			"tafsir": "This verse describes a woman who is divorced by her husband and is likely to remarry, whether she is marrying her ex-husband or another man. In responding to this verse, fiqh scholars differ about who is meant by the verse, especially in the sentence \"do not hinder\". Imam Syafi'i is of the opinion that the prohibition is aimed at saints, based on a hadith narrated by Imam al-Bukhari about Qasim Ma'qil bin Yasir. Ma'qil had a sister whom Abibaddah married. Then she was divorced by her husband. After his end, Abibaddah felt sorry and wanted to return to his ex-wife. But Ma'qil, as the guardian, did not agree with this so that this event was known by Rasulullah saw and then the verse above was revealed and Ma'qil allowed Abibaddah to return to his brother. From the history which is the reason for the revelation of this verse, it is clear that the prohibition is aimed at saints. If the prohibition in the verse was not directed at the guardian, surely the woman could marry herself and would not have to be delayed by Ma'qil's attitude as her guardian. So it is clear that the marriage contract is still carried out by the guardian. Imam Hanafi argues otherwise; the prohibition is addressed not to the guardian but to the husband. This can happen if the ex-husband prevents his ex-wife from marrying someone else. Thus, according to Abu Hanifah, this verse does not indicate that a guardian is a legal condition for a marriage contract. As is well known, Imam Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that women with widow status can enter into a marriage contract without going through a guardian. Neither the guardian nor the ex-husband may prevent a woman from getting married. The custom that prevailed during the ignorant era of the guardians interfered too much in an arbitrary way about marriage so that women did not have the freedom to choose their future husband, they were even forced to marry men they did not like. Such is the teaching of the Qur'an regarding the law of marriage, a teaching which can only be accepted by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, because only those who believe can accept Allah's teachings by getting rid of the desires of lust which restrain women. Returning to Allah's teachings is a good and commendable deed, Allah is All-Knowing and you do not know."

			"tafsir": "Every mother (even if she is a widow) is obliged to breastfeed her child until the child reaches the age of two. It doesn't matter if the period of breastfeeding is less than this period if both parents see that there is a benefit. Likewise, every father is obliged to meet the needs of mothers, both clothing and food according to their needs. Mother is like a container for children while father is the owner of that container. So naturally the father is obliged to provide a living for the person under his responsibility and to maintain and care for his property. Allah makes it obligatory for mothers to breastfeed their babies, because breast milk has a great influence on their children. The results of research by medical experts show that breast milk consists of pure essence. Mother's milk is also the best food for babies, and is not in doubt by nutritionists. Apart from that, mothers with nature also have a deep sense of affection so that breastfeeding directly from the mother is closely related to the mental and mental development of the child. Thus it is not appropriate for the temporary action of mothers who do not want to breastfeed their children just because of their personal interests, for example, to maintain beauty. Even though this is against her own nature and indirectly she loses the opportunity to build the basis of a mother's relationship with her own child in the emotional field. Thus the distribution of obligations of both parents towards their babies arranged by Allah SWT. Meanwhile, relief from obligations is also given, for example if the mother's health is disturbed or a doctor says it is not good if the mother breastfeeds for some reason, then there is nothing wrong if the child receives milk or food from someone else. Likewise, if the father does not have the ability to carry out his obligations because he is poor, then he may carry out his obligations according to his ability. This relief proves that children cannot be used as a cause of harm, either to the father or to the mother. With understanding, this obligation does not have to apply absolutely so that it causes harm to both of them. One party may not harm the other party by making the child the scapegoat. For example, because the mother knows that the father is obliged to provide a living, she extorts herself by not breastfeeding or caring for the baby without a certain amount of money. Or the father is very stingy in providing a living so that the mother suffers because of it. Furthermore, if one of the mothers or fathers does not have the ability to carry out the obligations or dies, then those obligations are transferred to their heirs. The duration of the breastfeeding period is two years, however, if based on deliberations between the father and mother for the benefit of the child, they agree to stop it before reaching the two year period or continue it past two years, then this may be done. Likewise, if they take another woman to breastfeed their child, there is nothing wrong with this on the condition that the woman who breastfeeds is given appropriate remuneration, so that benefits are guaranteed for both the child and the woman who is breastfeeding. Fiqh scholars have different opinions about who has the right to breastfeed and care for the child, if there is a divorce between husband and wife. Is maintenance the mother's responsibility or the father's responsibility? Imam Malik is of the opinion that it is the mother who is obliged to breastfeed the child, even if she does not have milk; if he still has property then the child is breastfed to someone else using the mother's property. Imam Syafi'i in this case is of the opinion that this obligation is the obligation of the father."

			"tafsir": "The wife of a woman whose husband has died is four months and ten days. Although this verse seems general (covers all women who have been bereaved by their husbands), there are exceptions, namely those who are not pregnant. Because for pregnant women, there are other laws in other verses. This will be explained further in the interpretation of verse 240. During the iddah period she is not allowed to decorate, prepare herself to receive a proposal or make a promise to accept a betrothal. Likewise, he is not allowed to leave the house except for things that are permitted by religion. Because besides that period to know the cleanliness of the uterus (pregnant or not pregnant), it is also used as a period of mourning. When she is not pregnant, she is obliged to mourn respecting the relationship between husband and wife both for the late husband and for the husband's family. He must mourn as long as he is in beauty. After the expiration of the four months and ten days, it is permissible for him to do everything about himself in a reasonable way, for example accepting a proposal, leaving the house and doing other things that are not against religion. God knows all that is done by man. This verse emphasizes that regarding this period of mourning, Islam provides the best way that suits human needs. During the period of ignorance, women mourned for a full year and were not allowed to wear jewelry, eat delicious food or show themselves in public. Even in some groups of society, women who are going through this period of mourning have to do things that are far heavier than what people did during the ignorance era, such as: constantly crying and wailing. Not allowed to decorate himself and so on. Doing this mourning period is not only because of the death of their husband, but also because of the death of their children they mourn in this way. So what is precisely what is regulated by Islam is that the mourning period for a woman whose husband's death may not exceed four months and ten days and for the death of other relatives may not exceed three days. Deviation from this provision must be avoided because Allah is All-Knowing of all that is done by humans."

But that is absolutely not justified if the woman is in the Idah period of raj'i divorce. An expression that illustrates that the man has the intention to marry her, when his Idah is over, for example, the man says, \"I am very happy to have a wife who has characteristics like yours,\" or other expressions that do not lead to being frank. Allah forbids a man from making promises to marry, or persuading him to marry secretly or holding secret meetings. This is not justified because it is feared that there will be slander. A man is not prohibited from proposing to a woman who is still in the period of idah talak ba'in if the proposal is made insinuated, or is still in the planning, because Allah knows that humans cannot always hide what is in their heart. The proposal should not be made openly but should be in figurative words which are the introduction, which will be followed up in the form of an official proposal, when the woman has exhausted her beauty. Proposal with innuendo may not be made to a woman who is still in the idah of raj'i divorce, because there is still a possibility that the woman will return to her original husband. This method is intended so that the feelings of the bereaved woman are not offended, as well as to prevent bad reactions from the ex-husband's family and the general public. Therefore marriage contract with women who are still in Idah is prohibited. A ban that is considered haram qath'i, and the marriage contract must be cancelled."

The family is part of the community and in fulfilling all the needs and problems of his life, he encounters many difficulties which can sometimes lead him to things that are prohibited by religion. Because of that, a good way has been given for humans to always ensure their worldly relationship with piety to Allah by always maintaining prayer. Starting from waking up before making contact with other humans, he remembers and prays first with Allah (at dawn). Then after he had contact with the community, and it was very likely that an act occurred that was not pleasing to Allah, so to remind and save him, he was called to communicate again with Allah at noon (zuhur prayer). And so on for 24 hours. In this way, there is always a connection between human activity (to fulfill his life's needs) by remembering Allah and carrying out His commands. This has an influence and an imprint on the soul and human life as it is emphasized that by praying humans can avoid evil and unjust deeds. In addition, observing prayers is proof of faith in Allah, and is an absolute requirement for the life of a Muslim, strengthens brotherhood, and can guarantee human rights. According to Ahmad's history, the Messenger of Allah said: The agreement between us and the infidels is prayer, whoever leaves it (intentionally) then he has become a disbeliever. (Ahmad's history) In another hadith narrated by Ahmad and ath-thabrani, the Messenger of Allah said: Whoever always prays, he will receive light and guidance and will receive safety on the Day of Judgment. On the other hand, a person who does not observe his prayers will have no light, guidance or safety for him. In the afterlife he will be with Pharaoh, Haman, and Ubai bin Khalaf in hell. (History of Ahmad and ath-thabrani) The verses above explain how important it is to maintain and maintain prayer. Humans who carry out this order truly become Allah's creatures who are pious and their lives will always be safe, in the magfirah and the pleasure of Allah. As for the reason for this verse being revealed, according to a history from Zaid bin Sickle, that the Messenger of Allah always performed the midday prayers, even though it was hot during the day which was hard for his companions, so this verse was revealed. Allah commands Muslims to always pray five times a day. If the prayer is carried out, he can protect himself from doing things that are evil and unjust. Prayer can be a calming soul from all the anxiety that befalls oneself. Therefore prayer is the pillar of religion. Allah emphasized the wustha prayer. The wusta prayer according to the majority of Ulama is the Asar prayer. Allah also teaches us that in performing our prayers we should be humble and humble. Because the concentration of the mind on Allah alone is the best level of prayer and it is this prayer that can leave an impression on the human soul. Because of the importance of carrying out and maintaining this prayer a Muslim should not leave it even under any circumstances. Prayers are still not allowed to be abandoned, even in an atmosphere of concern for life, property, or position. In an old state, prayers can be performed according to the way that is possible, whether in a state of walking, driving, or sick. So after the old age disappears, especially those in the form of worries, let us be grateful to Allah, because Allah teaches people things that they do not know, including regarding the kaifiat (how to) perform prayers in times of insecurity\/during war."

In addition, observing prayers is proof of faith in Allah, and is an absolute requirement for the life of a Muslim, strengthens brotherhood, and can guarantee human rights. According to Ahmad's history, the Messenger of Allah said: The agreement between us and the infidels is prayer, whoever leaves it (intentionally) then he has become a disbeliever. (Ahmad's history) In another hadith narrated by Ahmad and ath-thabrani, the Messenger of Allah said: Whoever always prays, he will receive light and guidance and will receive safety on the Day of Judgment. On the other hand, a person who does not observe his prayers will have no light, guidance or safety for him. In the afterlife he will be with Pharaoh, Haman, and Ubai bin Khalaf in hell. (History of Ahmad and ath-thabrani) The verses above explain how important it is to maintain and maintain prayer. Humans who carry out this order truly become Allah's creatures who are pious and their lives will always be safe, in the magfirah and the pleasure of Allah. As for the reason for this verse being revealed, according to a history from Zaid bin Sickle, that the Messenger of Allah always performed the midday prayers, even though it was hot during the day which was hard for his companions, so this verse was revealed. Allah commands Muslims to always pray five times a day. If the prayer is carried out, he can protect himself from doing things that are evil and unjust. Prayer can be a calming soul from all the anxiety that befalls oneself. Therefore prayer is the pillar of religion. Allah emphasized the wustha prayer. The wusta prayer according to the majority of Ulama is the Asar prayer. Allah also teaches us that in performing our prayers we should be humble and humble. Because the concentration of the mind on Allah alone is the best level of prayer and it is this prayer that can leave an impression on the human soul. Because of the importance of carrying out and maintaining this prayer a Muslim should not leave it even under any circumstances. Prayers are still not allowed to be abandoned, even in an atmosphere of concern for life, property, or position. In an old state, prayers can be performed according to the way that is possible, whether in a state of walking, driving, or sick. So after the old age disappears, especially those in the form of worries, let us be grateful to Allah, because Allah teaches people things that they do not know, including regarding the kaifiat (how to) perform prayers in times of insecurity\/during war."

			"tafsir": "Allah advises husbands when he feels that he is nearing death, to make a will for his wife, namely by giving part of his wealth for shopping for one year, while remaining in his house. If the wife leaves the house after a year, then the husband's family may not hinder the wife's actions because they do not violate religious teachings. For example, to be active in society and show willingness to have another husband. Because, their status is free, unlike the customary ignorance, women are inherited property. Allah is Wise in establishing laws for the benefit of His servants. It is necessary to explain here, the views of the commentators regarding verse 240, that is, just as ushul experts have different opinions regarding nasikh and mansukh in the Qur'an, there are also differences among commentators. There are commentators who acknowledge the existence of nasikh and mansukh in the Qur'an and some who do not. Tafsirs who acknowledge nasikh in the Qur'an interpret that this verse commands the husband to make a will, namely to set aside part of his wealth for his wife who is left behind for a period of one year and she continues to live in her husband's residence. This shows that Idah died for one year. So between these two verses (240 and 234) there is a conflicting law. This group views that: (a) The verse indicating Idah's death is one year later than the verse which determines Idah's death is 4 months and ten days, but in history it was revealed earlier. On this basis, paragraph 234 which stipulates Idah died 4 months and 10 days enforces this law in paragraph 240. (b) If the existence of texts in the Qur'an is not recognized, then the zahir verse obliges the husband to make a will for his wife. Thus, the wife gets two kinds of parts, first the part as wife (heir) which is determined by the inheritance clause, and second, the part as a will according to this verse. However, this verse is substantiated by an authentic hadith which reads: (\"There is no will for heirs,\" [Ahmad and the Four Imams except an-Nasa'i]), so that the wife does not get two kinds of parts."

With this verse, Allah gives encouragement so that these qualities should not be imitated and humans should be persistent in fighting for the glory of the nation and religion. It also explains the news of people who fled from their homeland where their number is in the thousands. They should be brave, able to defend their homeland, but they are weak and lose heart because they are afraid of death. Pictured in the minds of those who fled was the way of salvation. Meanwhile, the opposite happened, that is, their flight meant strengthening the enemy's position to easily colonize them. To those who are cowardly like this, Allah says, \"Crush you because you are cowards.\" Then after their awareness came to reunite, Allah gave His grace by reviving their enthusiasm so that they rose up to gather strength to break free from the slavery of the colonialists because Allah has gifts, is Most Forbearing towards humans, however, humans are not grateful to Him. Even though Allah revives their enthusiasm as His gift, there are still many who are not grateful to Him. From this verse it can be learned that if a people always opposes God's teachings, then this people will always be in danger with various trials from Him. This has been sunatullah for the previous ummah until now. According to some commentators, this verse provides a lesson in the form of a comparative example for people who have lost their souls, who fled their country because they did not have the responsibility to defend it, so that their country became a colony. The people in it suffer poverty, humiliation and poverty because they are treated as slaves by the ruling class that comes from outside. But after that time passed, with the consciousness that Allah gave them their souls came back to life. They rose simultaneously to expel the unjust rulers. This is a gift from Allah Almighty and Most Merciful."

After being told about people who perished due to fear and weakness of faith, then in this verse Allah recommends that the people are willing to sacrifice to spend their wealth in the way of Allah and that living is called a loan. Allah calls it a loan even though Allah Himself is almighty, because Allah knows that the urge to spend wealth for the benefit of the people is very weak in the majority of people; only a small group are willing to do so This can be felt in that it is sometimes easy for a wealthy person to spend his excess wealth to help his friends, perhaps with the intention of protecting himself from crime or to maintain a high position, especially if the person being helped is his own relative. the treasure is to defend religion and maintain nobility yes and exalts Allah's words in which there are no things that benefit him directly in the world, then it is not easy for him to give up the treasure he loves, unless it is openly or through official channels. Therefore, the expression used to spend wealth in the way of Allah is very interesting, namely: \"Who wants to give a loan to Allah, a good loan.\" Good loans are in accordance with their fields and benefits and are issued sincerely solely to achieve the pleasure of Allah SWT. Allah promises to give a double reward. Allah gives a parable about the multiplied reward like a grain of rice planted can produce seven stalks of rice, each stalk contains 100 grains, thus producing 700 grains. In fact, Allah replied without limit according to what the Messenger of Allah requested for his people and according to the sincerity of those who provide a living. Allah swt limits sustenance to people who do not know sunatullah in matters of seeking property because they are not active in building in various fields that Allah has indicated. Allah extends sustenance to other humans who are good at adapting to the sunatullah and working on various fields of business so that they feel the benefits. If God makes a poor person rich or vice versa, then that is completely in the power of God. Allah's suggestion is to spend part of one's wealth in the way of Allah, solely for the benefit of man himself and to guide him to be grateful for the gift because being grateful will increase his blessings. Then Allah explained that all creatures will be returned to Him on the Day of Judgment to receive a reward for their respective deeds."

At that time, it was customary for the Children of Israel that state matters were governed by a king and religious matters were led by someone who was also obeyed by the king himself. Samuel (their prophet at that time) who knew the character of the Children of Israel, when he heard their proposal to appoint a king, doubts arose in his heart about the loyalty of the Children of Israel, so he said, \"Perhaps if war is ordered upon you, you will not want to fight. \" He often witnessed the cowardice among them. They replied, \"Why don't we want to fight in the way of Allah. Even though there are enough reasons to encourage us to carry out the war? We have been expelled from our homes and many of our children have been taken captive by the enemy.\" They stated that their suffering was severe enough that there was no other way, except by using violence. It turned out that what Samuel doubted was true, that is, when war was obligatory on the Children of Israel and Samuel had chosen a king to lead them, many of them turned their backs and abandoned jihad in the way of Allah and very few remained firm on their promises. Allah knows those who do not participate in jihad and they are included in the class of people who are unjust, who abuse themselves because they do not want to wage jihad to defend rights and uphold the truth.

The people of the Children of Israel did not want to accept Talut as king on the grounds that, according to tradition, only the tribe of Judah could be made king, while thalut was from the Bunyamin tribe. After all, it is required that those who can become kings must be wealthy, while thalut are not wealthy. Because of that they spontaneously refused, \"How will thalut rule over us, when we are more entitled to control the government than him, while he was not given enough wealth to become king?\" Samuel replied that Thalut was appointed king by God's choice because of that God bestowed upon him extensive knowledge and a mighty body so that he was able to lead the Children of Israel. From this verse it can be understood that a person who will be made a king must: 1. Have physical strength so that he is able to carry out his duties as head of state. 2. Mastering broad knowledge, knowing the location of the people's strengths and weaknesses, so that they can lead them wisely. 3. Have physical health and mental intelligence. 4. Fear Allah in order to get His taufik and guidance, to overcome all difficulties that cannot be overcome alone, except with His taufik and guidance.

As a sign that the thalut has truly been chosen by Allah is the return of the Ark (treasure) to the Children of Israel after it had disappeared from their hands for several years because it was seized by the enemy. Inside the Ark were stored some of the remains of the families of Moses and Aaron, such as the staff of the Prophet Moses, sandals, the turban of the Prophet Aaron, and several pieces of broken stone plates that Moses brought from Mount Sinai. When the Children of Israel waged war, the Ark was always brought with them by the army because they felt that the Ark could inspire enthusiasm and courage in battle. In a war between the Children of Israel and the Amalik people, the Children of Israel suffered a defeat which resulted in the Ark being seized and taken away by the enemy. After the Ark had been in the hands of the Amaliks for some time, suddenly at one time the Amalik was struck by various calamities and calamities such as a rat plague that destroyed crops, and an outbreak of disease so that they felt unlucky to have the Ark in their midst. their middle. They thought that the disaster had come from the God of the Children of Israel who took revenge on them, so they returned the Ark to the Children of Israel by placing it in a cart pulled by two oxen. It turned out that the cart was being driven by an angel so that it returned to the Children of Israel. The arrival of the Ark was just in time with the election of Thalut as king. With the return of the Ark, then the Children of Israel submitted and accepted the thalut as king, because that is proof from Allah to those who believe."

He warned that the river was not an ordinary river but a river to test those who are firm in their faith and who will be tempted. He said, \"Whoever drinks from the river water, then he is not one of my followers, and whoever does not drink, then he is my follower, except if he drinks just a cup of hands.\" It is narrated that when the Children of Israel saw that the Ark had returned, they had no doubts that they would win, so they immediately prepared their army for battle. On the instructions of the king of thalut, only men who are young and healthy in body may join the war, not allowed a person who is building a house but has not finished it or a trader who is busy taking care of his business and not men who have debts and nor is the bride who has not gathered with his wife. With this selection, the king of Thalut can gather 80,000 soldiers who can be relied upon to fight. Because when they left it was summer and the journey was very far through the desert, they begged them to be given the opportunity to drink from the river on the way. Most of the soldiers did not heed the warnings of the king of Thalut. They drank to their heart's content from the river water and some drank only a cup of their hands, and very few did not drink at all. When the king of Thalut and those who believed had crossed the river to carry out jihad fi sabilillah, the people who had drunk said, \"We are not able today to fight Jalut and his army.\" Jalut was a man of great stature and king of the Amalik people. Such remarks do not frighten the faithful thalut soldiers who believe that they will meet Allah on the Day of Judgment with full determination. They said, \"How many times it happens that a small group can defeat a large group, with Allah's permission. For Allah is with those who are patient with their help."

Before the terrible battle occurred, the king of Jalut, whose body was very big and tall and wearing armor, arrogantly challenged him to do a one-on-one duel. From the Children of Israel themselves, no one dared to come forward to serve the challenge, so a young goat herder, Dawud (who later became a prophet) came and he expressed his willingness to face the king of Jalut. It turned out that all he used was a stone throwing tool which he always used to protect his goats from wolf attacks. Because the king of Jalut was wearing armor, it was very difficult for his body to be penetrated by stones. Because of that Dawud with his clever aim at the hole between the two eyes as his target, it turned out that his throw was right on target so that the king of Jalut fell down instantly because his forehead was penetrated by the stone bullet. After that Dawud took his sword and cut Jalut's neck so that it broke and separated from his body. So with the death of the king of Jalut, all the Amalik people were dispersed because the king had been killed. The entire army of the Children of Israel greeted Dawud, who was later made son-in-law by the king of Thalut, as a reward for his services. In addition to this victory, Allah also bestowed wisdom and kingdom on Dawud so that he became the first person to hold two positions at once, namely as prophet and king. If Allah did not reject the violence of some humans with some others, this earth would be destroyed; and if Allah had not rejected the evil and unjust people with those who did good, then the evil would have increased and destroyed the good people.

The apostle referred to here is the Prophet Musa as. He spoke directly to Allah swt. This experience was never experienced by the other apostles. Therefore the Prophet Musa as was called \"Kalimullah\", which means, \"The Prophet who was spoken to directly by Allah SWT\". 36) The next verse explains that Prophet Isa was given various miracles that were not given to others, for example: was able to speak while he was still in the cradle; can revive people who have died, and heal blind people and people who are affected by hair loss, with Allah's permission. Allah also supports him with the Holy Spirit, namely the angel Gabriel, besides that he himself has a pure soul. Finally the Prophet Muhammad was given a higher degree than the previous messengers, namely: he was declared the last prophet and messenger of Allah, for all mankind, while the other messengers were only sent for his people. The Islamic religion brought by the Prophet Muhammad applies to all people until the end of time. The Al-Qur'an that he received, besides being a guide for mankind, is also the greatest miracle for the Prophet Muhammad, which is unmatched throughout all time. Furthermore, this verse explains the condition of mankind after the death of the apostles who were sent to them. In general, when the apostles were still alive, their people could unite, but after the death of the apostles they clashed and fought, some even killed each other. Differences in understanding in matters of religion encourage them to berate each other, even discredit one another. Their fanaticism towards a sect or an imam causes them not to accept the truth put forward by other groups. These disputes occurred, even though they had received various clear explanations, and they were still arguing, so that some of them believed and the others disbelieved. If Allah had willed that human beings would not have disputes and were not hostile or murderous, Allah would have had the power to do so. If God did that, surely all humans would be well, and this world would be peaceful from human disputes. But Allah does according to His will, based on the wisdom and knowledge of the most high. God gave man character, mind, feelings and will, so that man can think and do better than other creatures on this earth, so that they think about God's power. If humans use their thoughts and feelings as well as possible, surely they will see the signs of Allah's power and greatness everywhere, because this vast expanse of nature is a sign of His power and greatness and all of that is His creation. God bestowed religion on humans through His messengers, to guide human reason to the right path. This is because the ability of the human mind is limited, especially regarding matters that are supernatural or abstract, such as the attributes of God, matters of the afterlife and so on. So that if there is a disagreement between them, then they can solve it with instructions from the religion. Differences of opinion that occur between humans is natural. But this difference of opinion must not lead to animosity that causes them to kill each other. History has shown that the Jews after the death of the Prophet Musa have clashed and divided. The same thing happened to Christians after the death of Prophet Isa until now. Between the various Christian groups there was a protracted fight, attacking and killing each other. One group does not want to worship at another group's place of worship, even though they share the same religion. The Muslim community was also not spared from divisions, even though when the Prophet Muhammad was still alive, they had become a unified people, and had great potential in forming a society that lived in harmony and helped each other. But then they became fragmented, because of differences in views, coupled with the fanaticism of sects and groups, so that their strength became weak; they become backward people, with a weak economy; as well as being the butt of other people. Whereas Allah has given instructions in the Qur'an: O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and Ulil Amri (those in power) among you. Then, if you differ on something, then return it to Allah (the Qur'an) and the Messenger (the Sunnah), if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the more important (for you) and the better the result. (an-Nisa'\/4:59)."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, believers are ordered to spend part of the property that has been delegated to them for the benefit of themselves and their families, or for the benefit of the general public. They must remember that there will come a day when there will be no opportunity for them to spend these assets, because on that day there will be the Day of Resurrection followed by the Day of Judgment. There are no more close friends to provide help, and no more people who can save and provide assistance. Property and children and grandchildren can not provide any help. Except those who come to God with a pure heart and many practices. People who do not want to spend their wealth in the world for the public interest (fi sabilillah), are people who deny Allah's favors. Thus they will become people who are unjust to themselves and to others. Unjust to oneself is because with that disobedience he will receive punishment from Allah. Unjust to other people, because he is reluctant to give other people's rights in his property, both in the form of zakat which has been obligated to him, as well as alms and various donations recommended by religion. There are various opinions of the scholars regarding the infaq or \"spending of assets\" referred to in this verse. Some say that what is meant by \"infak\" in this verse is obligatory infak, namely zakat, because at the end of this verse Allah mentions those who do not want to spend as infidels. If what is meant by infak here is only sunnah, namely \"alms\", of course those who do not give alms will not be called infidels. Some scholars are of the opinion that what is meant by infak in this verse is infak for the sake of jihad fi sabilillah, namely for the sake of the struggle to uphold Allah's religion and defend oneself and the state against threats from enemies. While other scholars argue that what is meant by infaq in this verse is obligatory infaq and sunnah infaq, namely zakat and alms. As for the words \"infidel\" in this verse, it means \"reluctant to tithe\" and not infidel in the sense of unbelief. Property according to Islam has a social function, in addition to personal interests. If someone has succeeded in obtaining property in a lawful way, then he has the obligation to spend part of his property for the benefit of himself and his family, and part for the public interest, whether in the form of zakat, alms or voluntary contributions for the public good. Paying zakat contains two kinds of benefits. First, the benefit for the person who pays zakat is to free him from the obligation that Allah has imposed on him. In this way he will gain His pleasure and reward, and will also remove his miserliness from himself. The second benefit is: that paying zakat also means purifying excess assets (remaining) after the zakat has been issued, because as long as the zakat has not been issued, the assets always contain the rights of other people, namely the rights of relatives, the poor, ibnu sabil and other people who need help (at-Taubah\/9: 103; ar-Rum\/30: 38; al-An'am\/6: 141; adz-dzariyat\/51: 19). Really very high wisdom contained in the Islamic Shari'a with regard to zakat. Because humans are generally miserly. If he succeeds in acquiring property, it is hard for him to spend his wealth for the benefit of others. There are even people who are reluctant to spend their wealth for their own sake, even though he has taken pains to collect it. If he remembers that one day he will leave this mundane world, and leave those possessions behind, he will not be miserly. The religion of Islam has demonstrated a very efficacious remedy for eradicating the curmudgeon of the human heart. Islam provides education and training to humans to be generous, generous, and willing to sacrifice for their own interests and the interests of others, namely the rules of zakat and alms (al-Baqarah\/2: 245, 261, 265, 274; an-Nur \/24:22). Alms and various donations that we give for the public interest are considered by religion as \"amal jariah\", a charity whose reward will continue to flow to the person who does it, even though he has passed away, as long as the results of his contribution can be enjoyed and utilized by the general public. In the payment of zakat and alms, a sincere intention is needed, namely to seek the pleasure of Allah and the farthest from pleasure, to want to be praised and flattered by humans. Paying zakat and alms is a manifestation of faith and gratitude to Allah who has promised to increase His grace to anyone who wants to be grateful. On the other hand, those who do not want to be grateful, so that they are reluctant to give tithes and give alms, will be threatened with punishment in the next day. \"Indeed, if you are grateful, surely I will add (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then surely My punishment is very severe.\" (Ibrahim\/14:7)"

Only He is the eternal life, who exists by Himself, and He is also the one who always manages His creatures without the slightest negligence. Then it is emphasized again that Allah is never sleepy. A person who is in a sleepy state will certainly lose consciousness, so he will not be able to do his job properly, even though Allah always takes good care of and takes care of His creatures, never loses consciousness or is negligent. Because Allah is never sleepy, of course He never sleeps, because sleepiness is the beginning of the sleep process. Sleeping people lose consciousness more than sleepy people. Another attribute of Allah mentioned in this verse is that He is the one who has power and has what is in the heavens and on earth. It is He who has unlimited strength and power, so that He can do whatever He wants. Everything is in His power, so that none of His creatures including the prophets and angels can provide help except with His permission, let alone the statues that the disbelievers consider to be their helpers. What is meant by \"help\" or \"intercession\" in this verse is the help given by angels, prophets and pious people to mankind on the Day of Resurrection to obtain relief or freedom from Allah's punishment. The intercession will occur by Allah's permission. In the hadith it is stated: The Prophet said, \"¦Then Allah said, \"The angels provide intercession, the Prophets provide intercession, and the believers also provide intercession.

God, but simply what He wanted them to know. Allah's chair covers the heavens and the earth. Allah does not feel the slightest burden in caring for His creatures in the heavens and on earth, and in all of His creation. Allah is Most High, Most Great. They do not know Allah's knowledge except what He has willed for them to know. Thus, what humans can know is only what can be reached by the knowledge that Allah has bestowed upon them, and the amount is very small compared to His extensive knowledge. This is emphasized by God in His word: \"¦ While you were given only a little knowledge.\" (al-Isra'\/17:85)"

Our only obligation is to convey Allah's religion to humans in a good and wise manner, as well as with reasonable advice, so that they enter Islam with their own awareness and will (an-Nahl\/16:125). If we have conveyed to them in this way, but they still do not want to believe, that is not our business, but God's business. We can't force them. In another verse (Yunus\/10:99) Allah says which means: \"Do you want to force them so that they become believers?\" With the advent of Islam, the true path was clearly visible and distinguishable from the misguided path. So there should be no coercion to believe, because faith is a belief in the heart and no one can force someone's heart to believe in something, if he himself is not willing. The verses of the Qur'an which explain the prophethood of Muhammad are quite clear. So it's up to everyone, whether to believe or disbelieve, after these verses reach them. This is the ethics of Islamic da'wah. As for the voices that say that the religion of Islam was developed by the sword are mere accusations and slander. The Muslims in Mecca before moving to Medina only prayed in secret, and they did not want to do it demonstratively in front of the infidels. This verse was revealed approximately in the third year after the Hijra, that is, after the Muslims had real power and their numbers had increased, but they were not allowed to coerce non-Muslims, either in a subtle way, let alone by force. As for the wars that have been carried out by the Muslim community, both in the Arabian Peninsula, and in other countries, such as in Egypt, Persia and so on, were merely an act of self-defence against attacks by the infidels on them. In addition, wars are carried out to secure the course of Islamic da'wah, so that various acts of tyranny by infidels who slander and disturb Muslims because they adhere to and practice their religion can be prevented, and so that infidels can respect personal freedom and human rights. in believing. In various areas that have been controlled by Muslims, people who have not embraced Islam are given the right and freedom to choose: whether they will embrace Islam or will they remain in their religion. If they choose to remain in their original religion, they are required to pay a \"jizyah\" i.e. a kind of tax in exchange for the protection that the Islamic Government provides them. Their safety is fully guaranteed, as long as they do not take actions that are hostile to Islam and its people. 37) This is clear evidence that Muslims do not use coercion, and even respect religious freedom, even against minorities who are in their areas of authority. . On the other hand, we can see from historical evidence, both in the past and in modern times, how unfortunate the fate of Muslims is when they become a minority group in a country. This verse further explains that whoever no longer believes in the thagut, or no longer worships statues, or other objects, but believes and worships Allah alone, then he has got a firm grip, like a strong rope, which will not separated. True faith is faith that is believed in the heart, spoken with the tongue and accompanied by deeds. That is why at the end of the verse, Allah says which means: \"Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing\". This means that Allah always hears what is said, and He always knows what is believed in the heart, and what the limbs do. Allah will repay a person's deeds according to their faith, words and deeds."

As for those who disbelieve, their protectors are satans who expel them from the light of faith to the darkness of disbelief. They are the residents of hell on the last day, and they will remain in it forever. If at one time the disbelievers get a little light of guidance and faith, the devil immediately tries to eliminate it, so that the faith that begins to blossom disappears, and they return to darkness. Therefore, the faith that has been instilled in the heart must always be properly cared for, cared for and nurtured so that it continues to develop and grow stronger, and the demons will not be able to damage it anymore. Fertilizers of faith are: worship, good deeds and deepen knowledge and teachings of Islam."

			"tafsir": "This verse exemplifies the condition and nature of the arrogant king Namrud of Babylon, when dealing with the Prophet Abraham as Allah's apostle. King Namrud was blessed by Allah with great power and kingdom, but he was not grateful for this blessing, even became an apostate and unjust. God's grace that should be used to obey God, he used to disobey Him, by doing deeds that are not pleasing to Him. Namrud who had taken Satan as his leader and protector, arrogantly said against Prophet Abraham, \"Who is your God that you call on us to believe in him?\" Ibrahim replied, \"My God is Allah who has the power to create creatures that were not there before, or bring people back to life who were already dead.\" So Namrud replied, \"Then I can also turn on and off.\" That is, to let live or not to kill someone he should have killed; and he can kill a person, that is, by killing him. Whereas what Ibrahim meant was that Allah created living things that did not exist before, namely by creating bones, flesh and blood, then breathing a spirit into them, or from creatures that had died, then Allah brought them back to life; on Resurrection Day. Allah also has the power to kill living creatures, not by killing them as is done by humans, but by expelling the spirit of these creatures when death comes or when the Day of Judgment occurs in the future. So Namrud's answer mentioned in this verse is mere mockery, not in accordance with what was meant by Ibrahim as. Because Namrud's answer had no value, Prophet Ibrahim did not heed that answer. Then he said, \"My Lord (Allah) has the power to make the sun rise from the east, so you raise the sun from the west.\" Namrud could not answer. That's why he was silent, did not move. Here you can see the difference between the Prophet Abraham and Namrud. Prophet Ibrahim as Allah's apostle who believed and obeyed Him, always received His guidance, so that he did not lose his mind and arguments in the debate, even his last argument regarding the proof of Allah's power could silence King Namrud. On the other hand, King Namrud, who was disobedient and disobedient to Allah, really did not receive His guidance, so he lost and could no longer move to answer Prophet Ibrahim's challenge. That is the result of people taking Satan as their leader and protector."

			"tafsir": "In this verse, Allah gives another parable, which also aims to prove His power. However, the character presented in this parable is not a person who denies and does not believe in His power, but rather a person who at first still doubts about God's power, but after seeing various clear evidence, he believes with all his heart and admits that God is Almighty over everything. It is said that the man once walked through a village which was reduced to nothing but rubble. The building had collapsed, so that the roofs that had fallen to the ground had been covered up by the ruins of the walls. Because he still doubted Allah's power, when he witnessed the rubble he said, \"Could Allah revive this village that had collapsed, and restore it to its original state?\" We can apply his doubts about Allah's power to be able to restore the village to its original state, to something bigger than that, namely: \"Is Allah's power to revive His creatures on the Day of Resurrection, after they are all destroyed on the Day of Judgment?\" Because that person is not a disbeliever, but a person who is still in a state of doubt about Allah's power, and he needs proof and information, then Allah does something that will give him this information and proof. It happened like this: After he found the village deserted and its buildings reduced to rubble, he still found fruit-bearing trees there. Then he stopped at a place, and after tethering his donkey he took some fruit and ate it. After eating he fell asleep. At that time Allah swt killed him, namely by removing his spirit from his body. One hundred years later Allah SWT brought Him back to life, by returning him to his original state, and returning his soul to his body. This process of \"reviving\" is quick and easy, without going through childhood and so on. The leftover food he had left before he was killed turned out to be intact and undamaged, while the donkey was dead, only bones remained. After he was revived as before, God asked him a question, \"How long have you been in that place?\" Allah swt asked that question to show him that he could not know everything, including things about himself. This turned out to be true. That person thought that he was only in that place for a short time, namely a day or half a day. Therefore he replied, \"I was in this place just a day or half a day\". Then Allah explained to him that he had been in that place a hundred years. Then Allah told him to pay attention to the remnants of food and drink that he left a hundred years ago, which were intact and undamaged. This proves the power of Allah, because usually food spoils after only two or three days. God also told him to look after his donkey which had become bones in that place. Then God showed him how He put the bones in their original place and arrangement. After that He gave him flesh and skin and other organs, and He breathed the spirit into the donkey's body so that it would live again. After seeing all these various facts, the person expressed his faith by saying, \"Now I really believe that Allah is Almighty over all things, including bringing back dead creatures to life.\" Based on that belief dispelled his doubts about the resurrection day. In this verse Allah swt. did not explain the person's name and the name of the country through which he passed. What is important in this verse is the lesson that can be drawn from that incident. The proofs of Allah's power shown in this verse are as follows: 1. That person is brought back to life after he has been dead for a hundred years. The donkey's bones provided evidence to confirm that the donkey had actually been dead for a long time. God has the power to bring him back to life. 2. The remains of his food and drink a hundred years ago were still intact, of course by the will and power of Allah. This proves His power because under normal circumstances, food and drink spoil after a few days. Or the food has indeed been spoiled, but Allah can restore it to the way it was before. This also shows His power. 3. The donkey that had been dead for a long time and only its bones were left, was revived by God as before. This is done in front of the person's eyes so that it can be seen for real. All of these things are clear evidence of Allah's power, and that Allah has the power to create something, and also the power to repeat the events of his creatures. So all kinds of doubts and doubts disappeared, and a firm belief arose about the oneness and power of Allah. He is Omnipotent over everything, including resurrecting and reviving His creatures in the afterlife after the apocalypse."

			"tafsir": "This verse adds another parable about Allah's power to bring back the dead. If in verse 258 the events of the dialogue between Prophet Abraham and King Namrud are stated, then in this verse the dialogue between Prophet Abraham and his God is told. With great humility and devotion to Allah, Ibrahim (as) made a request to Him that He would be generous to show him how Allah brings life to a dead creature. If you pay close attention, the request of Prophet Ibrahim gives the impression that he himself still has doubts about Allah's power to bring back the dead. Therefore God said to him, \"Do you still not believe that I can bring back a dead creature?\" However, what is meant in this verse is not that, because the Prophet Abraham did not have any doubts about the power of Allah. He submitted this request to Allah not because of doubts, but because he wanted to see with his own eyes how Allah would bring back a dead creature. So Ibrahim replied, \"I do not doubt the power of Allah in the slightest, but I submit this request to reach the degree of 'ainul yaqin, namely the belief that is obtained after witnessing it with my own eyes, so that my heart becomes more peaceful, and my belief becomes stronger and stronger.\" strong. Allah granted the request, then the Prophet Abraham was ordered to cut up four birds, then put the bird's body parts on a hill that was far from each other. Ibrahim was ordered to call the birds that had been cut into pieces, it turned out to be birds -the birds came to him in one piece as before. Of course Allah returned the birds to their original state beforehand, so that they could come to fulfill the call of Ibrahim as. can be fulfilled, so that his heart a feels at ease and his belief is getting stronger. Another opinion says that the Prophet Abraham was ordered to Abraham take the birds to be tamed. Then Allah swt told Ibrahim as to place each bird on a certain hill that was far from one another. After that Abraham was ordered by Him to call the bird. With a single call, the bird came to him docile and obedient. So will humanity in the hereafter. When Allah swt calls them with a single call, then the creature rises and comes to Him simultaneously, obedient and obedient. At the end of this verse, Allah swt warns Ibrahim and all humans, so that they truly believe that Allah is Almighty and All-Wise. Meaning: Power in all things, including reviving dead creatures and He is Wise, especially in giving guidance and guidance to His servants, towards the straight and true path."

			"tafsir": "The relationship between infaq) and the hereafter is very close. A person will not get any help from anyone in the hereafter, except from the results of his own charity while living in this world, including charity in the form of infaq in the way of Allah. How lucky is the person who likes to spend his wealth in the way of Allah, that person is like someone who sows a seed in fertile soil. The seed gave rise to a tree, and the tree divided into seven stalks, each stalk bearing fruit, and each stalk containing a hundred seeds, so that one seed produced a yield of 700 grains. This means seven hundred times over. Imagine how much the result would be if the seeds planted were more than one grain. The description as found in this verse is better than directly saying that \"one grain of seed will produce 700 grains\". Because the description contained in the verse above gives the impression that the good deeds done by someone are always growing and growing by God in such a way, so that they become multiplied benefits for those who do them, like the growth of plants planted by someone in fertile soil for profit. the planter. Disclosure about the developments that occur in plants as described in this paragraph has aroused the interest of botanists to carry out research in this matter. The results of their research show that a seed planted in good soil and grows a tree, generally produces more than a single fruit, some even numbering more than fifty stalks. So, not just a sprig. Each stalk contains more than one seed, sometimes even more than sixty seeds. Thus it is clear that the description given by the verse above that one seed is multiplied to produce seven hundred grains, is not an exaggerated description, but is reasonable, and in accordance with reality. On this basis, we can say that the more scientific investigations people carry out, and the higher the science and technology of mankind, the more the truths contained in the Holy Qur'an are revealed, both regarding objects, plants, animals, space space and so on. Many reports from the Prophet (s) describe the fortunes of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, to earn His approval and to uphold His religion. Among them is a hadith narrated by Imam Muslim: From Ibn Mas'ud, that he said, \"A man has come carrying a camel with a rope in his nose) then that person said, \"I spend this camel in the way of Allah\". saw said, \"With this living, you will get in the hereafter seven hundred camels which are also strapped in their noses.\" (Muslim History) At the end of this verse, two characteristics are mentioned among His attributes, namely Omniscient and All-Knowing. That is, Allah is almighty in His mercy to His servants; His gifts are countless. He knows best which of His servants deserves to be rewarded multiplied, namely those who like to spend their wealth for the public good. to uphold the truth, and for the benefit of national and religious education, as well as the virtues that will bring the nation to happiness in this world and in the hereafter. if the results are for the strength of religion and the happiness of the nation, then those who provide a living will also be able to enjoy it either in this world or in the hereafter. Islamic teachings regarding infaq are very high in value. Apart from eroding bad traits such as miserliness and selfishness, infaq also creates a deep social awareness that humans always need each other, and one cannot live alone. Therefore there must be mutual cooperation and mutual giving so that the gap between the rich and the poor can be eliminated, brotherhood can be fostered by closer relations. Spending wealth in the way of Allah, whether obligatory such as zakat, or sunnah such as alms which is used for the welfare of the people, to eradicate poverty and ignorance, for the propagation of Islam and for the development of knowledge is highly demanded by religion, and highly recommended by syara. '. Because of this, there are many verses in the Al-Qur'an that discuss this issue, as well as provide strong encouragement and provide parables that describe how lucky people who like to spend and how unfortunate people who do not want to spend their wealth."

			"tafsir": "The reward and luck that will be obtained by a person who spends his wealth in the way of Allah is conditional, namely: that he really gives his wealth sincerely, and after that he does not like to mention his infaq with words that can hurt the feelings of those who accept it. Such people are entitled to be rewarded by Allah, and there is no worry for them, and they do not feel sad. This means that a person who gives alms to someone, then mentions the alms and the gift in words that offend the feelings and honor of the person receiving it, then such a person is not entitled to be rewarded by Allah. This is a teaching of very high value, because there are people who donate their wealth not because they hope to please Allah, but only want popularity and fame and praise from the community, the infaq is broadcast in a conspicuous way, so that he is admired as a benefactor. Or when giving the alms he utters words that are not pleasing to those who receive it. This kind of giving is contrary to the purpose of religion, because it will not create a relationship of affection and brotherhood, but instead it will create hatred and enmity. Therefore it is natural that this kind of person will not get a reward from Allah. In short, spending wealth in the way of Allah must be with sincere intentions and holy intentions. It is for this sincere intention that Allah will reward him, and society will appreciate it. Rasulullah saw said: All deeds must be accompanied by intention. And every human being will get a reward for his deeds based on that intention. (History of Imam al-Bukhari from 'Umar bin al-Khaththab). People who spend with sincere intentions, apart from being rewarded by Allah, are also not worried about their fate, because they will surely be rewarded and pleased by Allah. They will not be sad either, they will even be happy later in the afterlife because they have been able to do good, and that kindness will bring them rewards. On the other hand, those who are reluctant to spend in charity will be sad and regretful in the afterlife, because there will be no more opportunities for them to do good. They will receive punishment from Allah."

Allah swt does not accept alms accompanied by hurtful words, because Allah only accepts good deeds done in good ways. Allah is Forgiving to His servants who do not accompany their alms with hurtful words, or who like to mention their alms after they are handed over or when they give them.

			"tafsir": "Those who believe do not lose their infaq or alms reward for accompanying it with hurtful words or by mentioning the infaq that has been given. Infak or alms aims to entertain and alleviate the suffering of the poor and to improve the welfare of the people. That is why alms should not be mentioned, or accompanied by words that hurt the recipient. If the charity is accompanied by such words, then the main purpose of the charity, which is to comfort and relieve suffering, will not be achieved. That's why Allah forbade it, and emphasized that such charity will not be rewarded. People who give alms out of joy are the same as those who pray with joy. Prayer worship will not be rewarded, and does not achieve the intended goal. Because the purpose of prayer is to turn your whole heart and soul to Allah SWT and to glorify His greatness and power, and to give thanks for all His blessings. As for people who pray out of greed, their attention is not on Allah, but on those who are expected to praise and flatter him. The nature of riya is a bad character. Some people want to be praised and extolled for a good deed they do. People who give alms who expect praise and gratitude from those who receive alms or from other people, if at one time he feels less praised and less thanks to him from the recipient or less appreciation of the recipient for his alms, he will feel very disappointed. In such circumstances, it is very likely that he will say words that offend the recipient, so that his alms will not be rewarded by Allah. People with this kind of character actually do not believe in Allah and the Hereafter. Such charity is like dust on a smooth stone; when heavy rains come, the dust disappears without a trace. Likewise, alms given out of joy will not bring any reward in the hereafter, because the deed is not done to gain the pleasure of Allah, but because it expects the praise of humans alone. Thus he gains nothing, neither in this world nor in the hereafter. In this world he does not get any results from his alms, because alms that are accompanied by joy or words that hurt the heart will only cause people to hate him, while in the hereafter, he will not get a reward from Allah, because of joy and words that displeasure it has erased his charitable merit. Allah swt rewards only those who do good deeds sincerely, wish to purify themselves and improve their condition, and seek only His pleasure. Allah gives a parable for alms accompanied by riya and swearing like the erosion of soil that is on a rock. Erosion is the process of removing soil from the earth's surface in general because it is transported by flowing water. The greater the rainfall that falls, the more and faster the soil particles are eroded. The process of forming soil on top of rock takes a long time, but heavy rains can easily and quickly transport the soil layer off the surface of the rock. If the soil on top of the stone has disappeared, then the stone is a particle that cannot grow plants. This parable illustrates that a person who works hard to collect wealth, then gives charity but the charity is accompanied by joy and swearing, then he will not get anything, neither benefit, reward nor the pleasure of Allah from what he gives. The habit of distributing money to beggars who usually crowd in front of the mosque after Friday prayers or Eid prayers, or in other places, apart from being seen as charity and social action towards the poor, also has an unfavorable effect, perhaps it can even be categorized as fun act. This habit will actually invite people we don't know to come to places of worship just to beg, not to join in worship, so that Islamic holidays are only a day of showing poverty everywhere. There is a mosque whose leadership forbids its congregation from giving alms to the beggars who used to flock to the city's mosque doors. It turned out that this method worked, because then no one came to the mosque to beg. The poor and the poor should be the responsibility of those who can afford it. We are grateful that now there are institutions that have been formed specifically to deal with this problem. Allah does not give guidance to those who disbelieve, because that guidance is based on faith. Faith is what guides a person to the sincerity of charity, and keeps himself from actions and words that can damage his deeds, and eliminate his reward. So in this verse there is an insinuation, that the cheerful nature and unpleasant words are some of the characteristics and actions of disbelievers that must be shunned by believers. Many hadiths of Rasulullah SAW denounce alms accompanied by offensive remarks. Imam Muslim narrated the following hadith from Abu dzarr, Rasulullah saw said: There are three types of people who on the Day of Resurrection Allah will not talk to them and will not look at them, and will not purify them of their sins, and they will receive a painful punishment , that is, people who like to mention their gifts when they give something, and people who like to wear their sarong so down that it sweeps the ground because of their arrogance, and people who try to sell their wares under false oaths. (Muslim history from Abu dzarr) Imam an-Nasa'i also narrated a hadith from Ibn Umar, from the Prophet PBUH, that he said: A person who always drinks khamr will not enter paradise, nor is a person who is disobedient to his parents, nor is anyone fond of mentioning his gifts. (History of an-Nasa'i from Ibn 'Abbas)"

			"tafsir": "Infak is likened to a garden that gets sufficient rainwater, so that the garden produces twice the usual yield. If the rain is not heavy, then a drizzle will suffice, because the garden is located on a high plateau that gets enough light and good air, and the soil is fertile. This verse is munasabah and is a continuation of the previous verse. In terms of the mechanism of erosion, the presence of land cover in the form of trees or plants can prevent or reduce the risk of erosion. Rain in mountain gardens is not the cause of erosion but provides benefits in the form of increased yields for the land cultivated as gardens. In this case, the expenditure of wealth to seek the pleasure of Allah is likened to a garden in the mountains that is watered with rain and produces twice as much fruit. If there were no heavy rains, in the mountain gardens, even a drizzle of rain would suffice to produce good fruit. In the view of ecological science, the situation described in verse 265 of Surah al-Baqarah above is true. This natural phenomenon clearly shows the greatness of Allah who arranges in great detail this nature, so that all creatures have the opportunity to glorify Him. Dew, or more correctly called fog, is a cloud that is in direct contact with the ground or trees. In English, two words are used for this natural phenomenon, namely fog and mist. The difference between the two is only in the density of cloud material. The word fog is used when the fog causes visibility to be less than one kilometer. Meanwhile, mist, is a state of fog that causes visibility to be less than two kilometers. Fog differs from other clouds only in that it is in contact with the surface of the earth. This situation can occur both in the lowlands and mountains. Fog appears when there is a difference in air temperature and the freezing point of water of 3oC or less. Fog begins when water vapor condenses into very fine water droplets in the air. This water vapor compaction then appears and becomes what is called a cloud. Fog generally occurs in very humid areas. Humid conditions can occur due to the addition of water vapor in the air, or decreased air temperature. However, sometimes fog can occur without these conditions. In general, fog occurs when the air humidity reaches 100%. In this condition, the air is no longer able to bind the water vapor in the air. Haze classification can be done due to differences in causes, properties, and others. For example there is a fog that can occur and disappear in a short time. This fog is commonly referred to as flash fog. There is also a fog known as sea fog. that occurs above sea level. Here, the occurrence of fog is strongly influenced by the presence of salt. Tiny salt particles will fill the air above sea level for various reasons. Among other things caused by wind or splashing waves and other causes. These tiny salt particles will then act as water vapor collectors. There is also a type of fog that is caused by changes in temperature at dusk or in the morning or when there is a cold wind passing through warm waters, or rainwater passing through a layer of hot air, causing evaporation. Fog often produces rain in the form of drizzle. This situation generally occurs because the air humidity has exceeded 100%. Soon the clouds will turn into raindrops. Especially when the fog layer rises to the top and comes into contact with cold temperatures at the top. In relation to fog, ecologists have found a unique forest type because it is very closely associated with fog. This forest is commonly referred to as a cloud forest or fog forest. Such forests refer to wet rain forests in the highlands, either in tropical or subtropical mountains. Generally, this fog layer will thicken at the tops of forest trees (canopy). In general, fog forests are not very extensive and are limited to areas where the atmospheric environment is suitable for fog formation. The forest is also characterized by an almost constant presence of fog, which makes it less likely that the plants will receive direct sunlight. The trees in this area are characterized by growing shorter and smaller. This size is very different from the same type and grows in the lowlands or other parts of the mountains that get full sun. High humidity encourages the growth of epiphytic plants attached to tree trunks and branches, most of which are dominated by groups of mosses and ferns. The presence of these vines and moss also characterizes that this is a fog forest. Within the fog forest, the main source of water is the water droplets that come from the mist. Condensation of mist water vapor will occur mainly in the leaves of trees, and fall in the form of water droplets to the forest floor. A natural phenomenon which is located in an area very far from the place where the Qur'an was revealed, but which is explained in detail in the Qur'an, is proof that this holy book was not created by humans. Only God, the All-Knowing, could have sent down a verse like this. It is said that what is likened to a garden is a person who spends his wealth, because he realizes that he has received a lot of grace from Allah, so he is willing to give a lot of infaq; even though once upon a time he received a little grace, he still gave infaq. Spending wealth in the way of Allah or spending, can really strengthen the soul. Because love for property has become a human nature, because his love for property is very hard for him to spend it, let alone for the benefit of others. So if we give alms, for example, it is an act that can strengthen the heart to do good, and eliminate the influence of wealth attached to the soul. This verse closes with His words: Wallahu bima ta'maluna bashir (God always sees what you do). This means that Allah always knows the good deeds that His servants have done, including spending with sincere intentions, so He will reward them. On the other hand, Allah also knows all bad deeds, so He will reward them with punishment. (266) In this verse, Allah SWT also provides an example for someone who spends his wealth not to please Allah, but for joy, or his charity is accompanied by words that hurt his feelings or like to mention the alms he has given. This person is likened to a person who has a garden filled with various plants, and the garden gets enough water from a flowing river, so that it produces a lot of fruit. The person is elderly, and has children and grandchildren who are still small and have not been able to earn their own sustenance. Thus, that person and his children and grandchildren really need the results of the garden. But suddenly came a hot samum wind. So that the trees and plants become damaged, not bringing any results, even though he really hopes for it. Such is the condition of those who spend their wealth not because of Allah. He thought that he would get a reward from his alms and infaq. But that's not really the case, the reward will disappear because of his intentions that are not sincere. He spends only because of riya, following the devil's whisper. Not because expect the pleasure of Allah swt. With these clear explanations and parables, Allah SWT explains His verses to His servants so that they think and can take inspiration and lessons from these parables."

In terms of the mechanism of erosion, the presence of land cover in the form of trees or plants can prevent or reduce the risk of erosion. Rain in mountain gardens is not the cause of erosion but provides benefits in the form of increased yields for the land cultivated as gardens. In this case, the expenditure of wealth to seek the pleasure of Allah is likened to a garden in the mountains that is watered with rain and produces twice as much fruit. If there were no heavy rains, in the mountain gardens, even a drizzle of rain would suffice to produce good fruit. In the view of ecological science, the situation described in verse 265 of Surah al-Baqarah above is true. This natural phenomenon clearly shows the greatness of Allah who arranges in great detail this nature, so that all creatures have the opportunity to glorify Him. Dew, or more correctly called fog, is a cloud that is in direct contact with the ground or trees. In English, two words are used for this natural phenomenon, namely fog and mist. The difference between the two is only in the density of cloud material. The word fog is used when the fog causes visibility to be less than one kilometer. Meanwhile, mist, is a state of fog that causes visibility to be less than two kilometers. Fog differs from other clouds only in that it is in contact with the surface of the earth. This situation can occur both in the lowlands and mountains. Fog appears when there is a difference in air temperature and the freezing point of water of 3oC or less. Fog begins when water vapor condenses into very fine water droplets in the air. This water vapor compaction then appears and becomes what is called a cloud. Fog generally occurs in very humid areas. Humid conditions can occur due to the addition of water vapor in the air, or decreased air temperature. However, sometimes fog can occur without these conditions. In general, fog occurs when the air humidity reaches 100%. In this condition, the air is no longer able to bind the water vapor in the air. Haze classification can be done due to differences in causes, properties, and others. For example there is a fog that can occur and disappear in a short time. This fog is commonly referred to as flash fog. There is also a fog known as sea fog. that occurs above sea level. Here, the occurrence of fog is strongly influenced by the presence of salt. Tiny salt particles will fill the air above sea level for various reasons. Among other things caused by wind or splashing waves and other causes. These tiny salt particles will then act as water vapor collectors. There is also a type of fog that is caused by changes in temperature at dusk or in the morning or when there is a cold wind passing through warm waters, or rainwater passing through a layer of hot air, causing evaporation. Fog often produces rain in the form of drizzle. This situation generally occurs because the air humidity has exceeded 100%. Soon the clouds will turn into raindrops. Especially when the fog layer rises to the top and comes into contact with cold temperatures at the top. In relation to fog, ecologists have found a unique forest type because it is very closely associated with fog. This forest is commonly referred to as a cloud forest or fog forest. Such forests refer to wet rain forests in the highlands, either in tropical or subtropical mountains. Generally, this fog layer will thicken at the tops of forest trees (canopy). In general, fog forests are not very extensive and are limited to areas where the atmospheric environment is suitable for fog formation. The forest is also characterized by an almost constant presence of fog, which makes it less likely that the plants will receive direct sunlight. The trees in this area are characterized by growing shorter and smaller. This size is very different from the same type and grows in the lowlands or other parts of the mountains that get full sun. High humidity encourages the growth of epiphytic plants attached to tree trunks and branches, most of which are dominated by groups of mosses and ferns. The presence of these vines and moss also characterizes that this is a fog forest. Within the fog forest, the main source of water is the water droplets that come from the mist. Condensation of mist water vapor will occur mainly in the leaves of trees, and fall in the form of water droplets to the forest floor. A natural phenomenon which is located in an area very far from the place where the Qur'an was revealed, but which is explained in detail in the Qur'an, is proof that this holy book was not created by humans. Only God, the All-Knowing, could have sent down a verse like this. It is said that what is likened to a garden is a person who spends his wealth, because he realizes that he has received a lot of grace from Allah, so he is willing to give a lot of infaq; even though once upon a time he received a little grace, he still gave infaq. Spending wealth in the way of Allah or spending, can really strengthen the soul. Because love for property has become a human nature, because his love for property is very hard for him to spend it, let alone for the benefit of others. So if we give alms, for example, it is an act that can strengthen the heart to do good, and eliminate the influence of wealth attached to the soul. This verse closes with His words: Wallahu bima ta'maluna bashir (God always sees what you do). This means that Allah always knows the good deeds that His servants have done, including spending with sincere intentions, so He will reward them. On the other hand, Allah also knows all bad deeds, so He will reward them with punishment."

			"tafsir": "person who is truly a believer, will undoubtedly spend something good, if he intends to purify himself and strengthen his soul. Something that is spent, is likened to a seed that produces seven hundred grains, or that is likened to a garden located on a plateau, which gives good results, of course something good, not something bad that is disliked by those who spend it, or he himself would not have accepted it, had he been given such a thing. However, even those who give charity should not be forced to give only the good of what they have, as mentioned above. The Messenger of Allah once said to Mu'adz bin Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: From Ibn Abbas ra that the Prophet sent Mu'adz to Yemen \"then he mentioned the hadith\" and to him: that Allah obliges them to give zakat on their property taken from the rich then handed over to the poor among them. (History of Muttafaq 'alaih) From the information above it can be understood that Allah is very disapproving if the charity consists of bad things. This does not mean that the goods that are given in charity must be the best, but that which is reasonable, and the person who spends himself likes it if he is given it. In another verse, Allah says: You will not get good before you spend some of the wealth that you love. ¦ (Â'li 'Imran\/3:92) At the end of this verse Allah says, which means the following \"Know that Allah is Rich and Most Praised.\" This is a warning, especially to those who like to spend on bad things, that Allah does not need such alms. He will not accept it as a good deed. If someone really wants to do good and seek the pleasure of Allah, why does he give bad things, which he himself does not like? Allah is Rich. Most Praised and proper praise to Allah is that we are willing to spend something good from our possessions, which Allah has given us."

Satan imagines to them that spending or giving alms will consume their possessions and will cause them to become poor and miserable. Therefore their possessions must be kept in preparation for the future. Spending on bad things, and reluctance to spend on good things, is called by Allah a crime, not a virtue, because a person who is of this nature means believing in Satan and not being grateful for Allah's blessings and not believing in Allah's wealth and His power to give additional grace. to her. Allah promises to His servants through His messengers, to give forgiveness for many mistakes, especially in matters of property. Because it is human nature to love possessions so it is hard for him to spend it. In addition to promising forgiveness, Allah also promises those who spend money will receive compensation for the wealth they spend. In the world he will gain glory and good name among his people because of his sincerity in spending or by increasing the remaining assets. In the afterlife he will receive a double reward. In this connection Allah says: ... And whatever you spend, Allah will replace it and He is the best provider of sustenance. (Saba'\/34:39) Giving is one way to be grateful. So a person who spends sincerely is a person who is grateful to Allah who has bestowed the property on him and He will add His grace to that person. His words: ¦Indeed, if you are grateful, I will surely add (favors) to you, but if you deny (My favors), then surely My punishment will be very heavy. (Ibrahim\/14:7) Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated a hadith, which says that the Messenger of Allah said: \"There is not a day where the servants of Allah are in the morning, unless two angels come down. One of The angel prayed, \"O Allah, give to the person who spends (his property) in exchange.\" And the other angel prays, \"Give it to someone who is reluctant (to donate his wealth) to annihilation.\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) by \"replacing\" the wealth that is spent is: Allah will make it easy for him to obtain sustenance, and he will gain respect in society. Meanwhile, what is meant by \"annihilation\" is that his property is used up without benefiting him. At the end of this verse Allah swt reminded that He is almighty in mercy and His bounty gives forgiveness and compensation for the wealth that is spent. Allah is All-Knowing of what His servant spends, so He will not spare he wastes it, he will even be given a good reward."

For example, someone says: \"If I pass the test, I will give charity a few rupiahs\", or \"will fast for a few days,\" or \"When I recover from my illness, then I will donate my wealth to repair the mosque.\" This kind of vow is of course good and permissible in religion, because passing a test, or recovering from an illness is a gift from God that should be grateful for. Fasting, giving alms, and donating wealth for the benefit of religion and public welfare, are good and beneficial deeds. But there are also vows that are not good, even cause damage, so such vows are of course not pleasing to Allah SWT. For example someone says, \"If later I talk to my brother, then I have to fast for so many days (meaning, he will not make up with his brother).\" Such a vow is not justified in religion, because even though fasting is good, being enmity with your own brother is a disgraceful act. Whatever infaq and vows we do, Allah always knows, so He will reward or punish. If the goods that are donated or that are promised are good, and are fulfilled in good ways, namely sincerely and solely hoping for the pleasure of Allah, then Allah will reward him with a double reward. On the other hand, if the item that is given or promised is bad, or is done in ways that are not good, for example by mentioning it, or accompanied by words that offend, or done with joy, then Allah will not accept it. as a good deed, and will not repay it with any reward. Likewise those who are reluctant to spend their wealth in the way of Allah, or he spends it to commit immorality or he does not want to carry out the vows he has uttered, then Allah will reward him with punishment. At the end of this verse, Allah swt confirms that there is no helper for those who do wrong. This is a warning, that reluctance to spend wealth in the way of Allah, reluctance to fulfill vows that have been uttered or carry out infaq and vows in bad ways, all of these are unjust acts. Allah swt will reward him with punishment, no one can escape from this punishment, even if he redeems it with his own charity. In this connection, Allah says in another verse: ... There is no loyal friend for the wrongdoer and there is no helper who is accepted (his help)¦(al-Mu'min\/40: 18). Spending wealth in the way of Allah, whether it is charity to relieve the suffering of the poor, or infaq for the public, state and religious interests, is the obligation of those who have property, as members of society. If he is reluctant to fulfill it, or is carried out in unnatural ways, then he himself will suffer the consequences. Because it is very natural if Allah threatens them with punishment as mentioned in the verse above."

Because, showing charity will remove accusations of miserliness against him, and those who hear it will be grateful and pray for him, and they will respect and imitate his actions. Furthermore, Allah explained, that if alms are given secretly and are not known by other people, then such a method is even better, if this is done to avoid feelings of ridicule in his heart, so that the poor who receive them do not feel inferior. towards others, and is not looked down upon in society. Because giving alms secretly, will grow sincerity in charity for the giver. Sincerity is the soul of every worship and good deeds. Many hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad praise the giver of alms in this hidden way. Among these hadiths narrated by Iman al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah ra. A just Imam (leader), and a young man since childhood who has been educated and likes to worship Allah, a person whose heart is always attached to the mosque, and two people who love each other in carrying out the religion of Allah, they come together and separate for that purpose, and a man who invited by a woman who has a good position and beauty to commit adultery but she refuses by saying, \"I fear Allah, Lord of all the worlds\", and those who give charity and keep it secret, so that his left hand does not know what his right hand emits, as well as someone who remembers Allah when he is alone, then he cries.\" (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurairah). Imam Ahmad and Ibn Abi Â¦atim narrated a hadith from Abu Umamah that Abu dzarr said: I once asked the Messenger of Allah, \"O Messenger of Allah, which charity is the most important?\" So Rasulullah saw replied, \"Alms in secret given to the poor, or the hard work of people who are lacking.\" (History of Ahmad and Ibn Abi Â¦atim) Allah will cover and erase some of the mistakes that have been made by people who spend their wealth in a good way, according to the alms they give, in addition to the reward they will receive later. Then Allah warns, that He always knows what His servant does, as well as the intentions that encourage him to do it. All of that will be rewarded according to his deeds and intentions."

It is further stated that whatever good property a person spends sincerely, surely Allah will reward him with sufficient reward and he will not be harmed in the slightest, because people who like to spend sincerely are certainly loved and respected by society, especially by The poor; and the reward will not be reduced in the sight of Allah."

			"tafsir": "Characteristics and conditions of people who are more deserving of receiving alms, namely: 1. Those who have sincerely devoted themselves to tasks within the framework of jihad fi sabilillah, so they do not have the opportunity to do other work as a source of sustenance. For example, the muhajirin, who at the beginning of Islam were among the poor, because they had left their possessions in Mecca, to be able to emigrate to Medina, in order to maintain and develop the Islamic religion. They often fought on the battlefield, fending off the tyranny of the unbelievers so that they had no free time to make a living. 2. The poor are unable to do business, either by trading or by other jobs, because they are weak, or are old, or for other reasons. 3. Poor people who are considered by other people as people who are sufficient, because they are patient and refrain from begging. 4. Those whose job is to memorize the Qur'an, study religious teachings and maintain the traditions of the Prophet in a simple way of life. The poor can be known from the signs that appear on them. They don't want to beg at all, or if they do ask, not pressuringly or forcefully. In this connection, Rasulullah saw said: The so-called \"poor people\" are not people who go around (to beg) people, who do not get a mouthful or two of rice, and one or two dates. But a true poor person is one who does not get enough for himself and whose condition is not known so that he is given alms, nor does he go begging from people. (Muttafaq 'Alaih) In Islam, begging or begging is forbidden, except in an emergency. The Messenger of Allah said: From Qabishah bin al-Mukhariq ra he said, \"I have dependents for the people. Then I approached the Messenger of Allah to ask for funds from him to pay for the dependents. He replied, \"Wait later when the zakat funds come, I will order that you are given from that fund.\" The Prophet then said, \"O Qabishah, begging is not lawful except for one of three people. First, a person who has dependents for the people, he is lawful to beg until he can pay off his debts, then he stops not begging anymore. Second, people who are hit by a disaster that destroys their wealth. He may beg until he can uphold his life. And third, people who are overwritten by poverty until there are three wise people who say that the person is really overwritten by poverty. He is lawful to beg until he can uphold his life. Begging outside of that, O Qabishah is an illegal act that is eaten by the culprit in an illegal way.\" (Muslim History) In the relationship of infaq, namely zakat and alms, it is necessary to emphasize here the following matters: 1. Islam has recommended to people who are wealthy so that they give alms to the poor. When giving charity, good things should be given, in the form of food, clothing and so on, and should not be accompanied by words that offend. That is, the poor must be treated as best as possible. 2 .The recommendation to donate does not mean that Islam increases the number of poor people and encourages them to beg and always expects alms from other people as a source of their sustenance.Because, on the one hand, Islam requires zakat and encourages alms to rich people for the poor, but on the other hand, Islam encourages the poor to try to escape from poverty, so that they can live they do not depend on the alms and gifts of others. In this connection, there are verses from the Al-Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet which recommend working hard, eliminating laziness and negligence, and praising those who can make a living by their own efforts and hard work. Allah says: ¦ Surely Allah will not change the condition of a people before they change their own condition. ¦ (ar-Ra'd\/13: 11). What is meant by \"what is in them\" includes, among other things, bad qualities which are the cause of poverty. For example, laziness, negligence, dishonesty, refusal to study to have work skills, and so on. If they change these traits with good traits, namely diligent work, then Allah will provide a way for them to improve their lives. In another verse, Allah says: \"When the prayers have been performed, then scatter you on the earth; seek Allah's bounty ¦.\" (al-Jumu'ah\/62:10). The Messenger of Allah praised the person who obtains sustenance from the results of his own toil and sweat. He said: \"The best food for a person to eat is from his own work\". the hand that gives), is better than the hand that is below (the hand that receives alms or other people's gifts).\" (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Thus, Islam wants people who have wealth to help the poor. On the other hand, Islam guides the poor to try hard to escape poverty."

			"tafsir": "There are two known kinds of usury, namely: 1. Riba nasi'ah 2. Riba fadhal Riba nasi'ah is an additional debt payment provided by the debtor, due to a request for a delay in payment of the debtor. The additional payment is requested by the creditor every time the debtor requests a delay in payment of his debt. Example: A owes B Rp. 1,000 and will be returned after a month's expiration. After the month ended, A was unable to pay his debts, so A asked B to be willing to accept a delay in payment. B is willing to postpone the payment due on the condition that A increases the payment, so that it becomes IDR 1,300. - This additional payment with a similar delay is called usury nasi'ah. This additional payment may be made many times because the debtor always asks for a delay in payment, so that finally A is no longer able to pay it, and sometimes he even has to sell himself to pay off his debt. This is what is meant by the word of Allah: \"O you who believe, do not eat usury multiplied and fear Allah, so that you will get good luck. (Ali 'Imran\/3:130). Riba nasi'ah as mentioned above widely applied among ignorant Arabs. This is usury which is meant by the Qur'an. If we study and follow the usury system in this verse and what was in effect during the ignorance era, there are several things that need to be considered: 1. The interest system is a profitable system for who lends and is very detrimental to the borrower. There are even times when the borrower is forced to sell himself to be used as a slave so that he can pay off his loan. 2. That act during the time of ignorance included efforts to seek wealth and to accumulate wealth for those who lent. According to Umar Ibn Khaththab, verses of the Qur'an about usury, including the last verse revealed. Until the Messenger of Allah died without explaining what is meant by usury. So riba remains a in a general sense, such as the interest system imposed by the Arabs in the time of ignorance. Umar's explanation means that the Prophet deliberately did not explain what is meant by usury because the Arabs already knew exactly what was meant by usury. When it is called usury to them, then in their minds there is already a clear understanding and they have agreed on that meaning. Their understanding of usury is usury nasi'ah. In other words that actually the Qur'an has explained and explained what is meant by usury. This is in accordance with the words of the Prophet regarding his two legacies that must be obeyed: I have left you two things, which if you stick to them, you will not go astray after me, namely the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet. (History of Ibn Majah) The religion brought by the Prophet Muhammad is a religion that has been perfect and complete received by him from Allah, there is nothing that has not been passed down to him. ¦.Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My favors for you, and I have accepted Islam as your religion¦. (al-Ma'idah\/5:3) Fadhal riba, namely selling a kind of goods with the same type of goods with the provision of giving additional rewards for types of good quality, such as selling 20 carat gold with 24 carat gold with an additional 1 gram of gold in return for 24 carat gold. Fadhal riba is also forbidden. The legal basis for the prohibition of usury fadhal is the words of the Prophet Muhammad: Do not sell gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, sya'ir (rice field) for sya'ir, tamar for tamar (dates), salt for salt, except the same type and amount and equally in cash. Whoever adds or asks for more, then in fact he has done usury. (History of al-Bukhari and Ahmad) The same type and level and the same amount of money, the meaning is not to harm one of the 2 people who are bartering. The verse above explains the consequences that will be experienced by people who eat usury, namely their souls and hearts are not peaceful, their minds are uncertain. Their situation is like someone possessed by a demon or like a madman. The ignorant Arabs believed that the devil could influence the human soul, as well as the jinn. If a demon or genie has influenced a person's soul, then he is like a person possessed. The Qur'an likens the effect of usury on someone who commits it, with the influence of the devil that has entered a person's soul according to the beliefs of the ignorant Arabs. The purpose of the parable in this verse is to facilitate understanding, not to explain that the Qur'an adheres to beliefs such as those of the ignorant Arabs. According to jumhur mufasir, this verse describes the condition of those who eat usury when they are resurrected on the Day of Resurrection, that is like someone who has been possessed by a demon. This opinion follows that of Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn Mas'ud. Also based on the words of the Prophet Muhammad: Stay away from sins that are not forgiven, namely: gulul (i.e. hiding spoils in war and others), so whoever does gulul, later hidden items will be brought with him on the Day of Judgment. And those who eat usury, whoever eats usury, he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection in a state of madness, again possessed by (a demon). (History of ath-thabrani from 'Auf bin Malik) In the reality that exists in human life in this world, many people who eat usury live their lives really uneasy, always anxious, just like someone possessed by a demon. The commentators argue that this verse describes the condition of usury eaters in the world. This opinion can be compromised with the first opinion, namely their situation in the hereafter will be the same as their situation in the world, there will be no peace for them. From the continuation of the verse it can be understood that the condition of those who eat usury is such that they can no longer distinguish between what is lawful and what is unlawful, between what is beneficial and what is harmful, between what Allah has permitted and what is prohibited, so they say buying and selling is the same as usury. Furthermore, Allah confirms that He justifies buying and selling and forbids usury. God does not explain why. Allah does not explain this so that those who eat usury can easily understand it, because they themselves have known, experienced and felt the consequences of usury. From this affirmation it is understood that it is as if God is giving a comparison between buying and selling and usury. Let man know, think and understand that comparison. In buying and selling, there are balanced exchanges and replacements made by the seller and the buyer, there are benefits and profits to be obtained from both parties, and there is also the possibility of obtaining a reasonable profit in accordance with the efforts that have been made by them. In usury there is no exchange and replacement in balance. There is only a kind of indirect extortion, which is carried out by those who have goods against those who are in need, who borrow under forced circumstances. After Allah explained the consequences experienced by those who eat usury, the words uttered by those who eat usury, the thoughts that are influencing the condition of those who eat usury, and Allah's confirmation regarding the law of buying and selling and usury, Allah invites those who eat usury with gentle invitations, which immediately permeate into their consciences, as the verse above continues. Allah swt calls the prohibition of usury by means of mau'idhah (teaching), meaning that the prohibition on eating usury is a prohibition aimed at the good of man himself, so that he can live happily in this world and the hereafter, live in an environment of love and compassion for fellow human beings and live a full life. peace and tranquility. Whoever understands Allah's prohibition and adheres to the prohibition, let him stop usury immediately. They are not punished by Allah for what they did before this verse was revealed. They are not required to return usury at the time this verse was revealed. They may take only the principal of their loan, without the interest they agreed to in advance. This paragraph contains a lesson that can be used as a basis for enacting laws, regulations or laws, namely: a law, regulation or law to be enacted may not apply retroactively if it results in harm to the parties subject to or burdened by the law. the law, regulation or law, on the contrary, may apply retroactively if it benefits the parties subject to or burdened by it. The end of this verse emphasizes that those who have committed usury, and those who have stopped doing usury, then do it again after this prohibition is passed, they are among the inhabitants of hell, they will remain therein forever. According to some commentators, the great sin that is inflicted on those who eat usury is because in the hearts of those who eat it have instilled a sense of love for wealth, prioritizing their own interests, doing things for their own sake, not because of Allah. Such a person is a person who is impossible to grow in his soul true faith, namely faith that is based on feelings, confession and submission to God. If such a usurer still claims to have faith in Allah, then his faith is only lip service, faith that is very thin and does not reach to the depths of his heart. Hasan al-Basri said, \"Faith is not an adornment of the mouth and empty wishful thinking, but faith is a strong pledge in the heart and is proven by deeds. Whoever says good with his tongue, while his actions are inappropriate, Allah rejects his confession. that. Whoever says good while his actions are good too, his deeds will elevate his rank,\" the Messenger of Allah said: \"God does not look at your physical form and your possessions, but God looks at your heart and your deeds.\" (History of Muslim and Ahmad)"

Scholars are of the opinion that what is meant by the words \"Allah destroys usury\" is Allah destroys the blessings of usury, because as a result of usury, enmity arises between people who eat usury, and the people's hatred towards them, especially those who have paid their debts with multiple usury. , and also causes the relationship distance between those who have and those who have not to widen. This hatred and enmity when it reaches its peak will cause war and chaos in society. Allah does not like those who deny His favor in the form of wealth that has been bestowed upon them. They do not use the property according to the conditions that have been determined by Allah, and do not give it to those who are entitled to receive it. Similarly, Allah does not like those who use and spend their wealth solely for their own sake, and seek wealth by oppressing or violating the rights of others."

			"tafsir": "This verse emphasizes good deeds that can prevent oneself from the actions of Allah's wrath. Allah mentions that people who have the four kinds of characteristics, which are mentioned in this verse, have no worries for themselves, and they are not sad about all the trials that Allah has inflicted on them. The four types of characteristics are: 1. Faith in Allah 2. Doing good deeds 3. Performing prayers 4. Performing zakat The four types of characteristics can be used as medicine to cure diseases caused by usury practices. If someone has faith in Allah, with true faith, even though he was previously a usurer, then that faith will encourage him to do good deeds. His faith will encourage him to pray and pay zakat which is the right of other people in his wealth. This verse gives a lesson to usury eaters who cannot control themselves to stop this act. It's as if God said, \"O usury eaters, stop eating usury. If you intend to stop it, while you yourself cannot control yourself to stop it, do the four kinds of things. If you do it right, you can definitely stop usury.\" People who have these four characteristics are peaceful in spirit, willing to face the trials that God has inflicted on them. Those who eat usury will not get it, all they get is anxiety, anxiety, indecision, like someone possessed by a devil."

			"tafsir": "Verse 275 describes the condition of people who eat usury in this world and in the hereafter and verse 276 describes the good education that must be carried out by those who eat usury to eliminate the consequences and effects of usury on him. All of that was conveyed in subtle expressions. This is the true attitude of Islam against usury. Allah commands that people who are faithful and pious stop the practice of usury. The order to leave usury is connected with the order to be pious. With this relationship, it is as if God said, \"If you really believe, leave usury. If you don't stop it, it means you have lied to Allah SWT in your confession of faith. It is impossible for people who claim to be faithful and pious to practice usury, because that act is not may exist in someone at the same time or time. What may happen is someone becomes a riba eater, or someone has faith and fears without eating usury.\" This verse is in line with the words of Rasulullah saw: \"An adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer.\" (Al-Bukhari history). This means that people who truly believe will not commit adultery, as well as those who truly believe will not commit usury. From this verse it is understood that faith that does not produce good deeds is a weak faith. Such faith does not sink deep into one's heart. Therefore it does not produce happiness in this world and in the hereafter."

The tone was already in the nature of a strong threat and was presented to people who already knew the law of usury, but they still continued to do it. This means that those who do not heed Allah's commands, are equated with people who fight Allah's religion. They will be fought by Allah and His Messenger. \"Warred by Allah\", meaning that Allah will inflict a painful doom on them in this world and in the hereafter. \"His apostles fought\" is the apostles have fought usury eaters in their time. People who eat usury are punished as apostates and opponents of God's law, therefore they may be fought. If usury eaters stop what they are doing, by following Allah's commands and stopping His prohibitions, they may receive their capital back, without deducting anything. According to the history of Ibn Jarir, verses 278 and 279 were revealed in connection with an agreement between Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib and someone from Bani Mugirah. They agreed during the time of the ignorant Arabs to lend money accompanied by interest to a person from the Saqif group from Bani 'Amar, namely 'Amar bin Umair. After Islam came they still had a large amount of usury left and they wanted to collect it. Then come down this verse. According to the history of Ibn Juraij: Bani Saqif had entered into a peace treaty with the Prophet Muhammad, on the basis that the usury they gave to others and the usury they received was abolished. After the conquest of Mecca, Rasulullah saw appointed 'Attab bin Asid as governor. Bani 'Amr bin Umair bin 'Auf lent money to Mugirah using usury, and vice versa. So when Islam came, the Bani 'Amr, who had a lot of usurious property, met Mugirah and asked for the property to be returned with the interest. Mugirah was reluctant to pay the usury. After Islam came, it was submitted to the governor 'Attab bin Asid. 'Attab sent a letter to Rasulullah saw. Then come down this verse. Rasulullah delivered the letter to 'Attab, the contents of which, among other things, confirmed Mugirah's attitude. If the Bani 'Amr accept, that is good, if they refuse it means they are against Allah and His Messenger."

On the other hand, if the debtor is in a condition of freedom, he must immediately pay off his debt. Rasulullah saw said: Delaying debt payments by rich people is an act of wrongdoing. (History of al-Bukhari and Muslim). Allah swt states that it is better to give alms to debtors who are unable to pay their debts. If the believers already know the order, let them carry it out. From this verse it is also understood that: 1. The command to give alms to people who are in debt, who are unable to pay their debts. 2. People who owe debts are obliged to give respite to people who owe debts if they have difficulty paying debts. 3 If someone has receivables from someone who is unable to pay his debts, try to make that person free from his debts by freeing him from paying his debts either in part or in whole or in another good way."

			"tafsir": "With the command to spend wealth in the way of Allah, the recommendation to give alms and the prohibition of usury, humans must try to maintain and develop their wealth, not to waste it in accordance with Allah's provisions. This shows that the treasure is not something that is hated by Allah and denounced by Islam. In fact, apart from giving orders for this, Allah also gives instructions and establishes general provisions and laws governing how to seek, maintain, use and spend wealth in the way of Allah. Wealth obtained in accordance with the provisions of Allah is the best treasure, in accordance with the words of the Prophet Muhammad: \"The best wealth is the property of pious people.\" (History of Ahmad and ath-thabrani from 'Amr bin 'Ash). What Allah hates and what Islam condemns is wealth obtained in ways that deviate from the provisions of Allah and the property of people who make themselves slaves of property. His whole life, efforts, and thoughts are devoted to accumulating wealth and enriching himself. Because of this, greed, greed, miserliness and miserliness arose in him, so that he did not pay attention to the poor and neglected. The Messenger of Allah said: \"Woe to the slaves of the dirhams, woe to the slaves of the dirhams.\" (Al-Bukhari's history from Abu Hurairah). In this verse, Allah orders believers to carry out Allah's provisions in every debt transaction, complete it with evidence so that it can be used as a basis for resolving disputes that may arise in the future. Evidence can be in the form of written evidence or witnesses. 1. Written evidence \"Written evidence\" should be written by a \"clerk\", who writes down the contents of the agreement that has been agreed upon by both parties. The terms of the scribe are: a. A fair person, impartial to one of the parties entering into an agreement, so that it does not benefit one party and harm the other party. b. Knowing the laws of Allah, especially those related to the law of agreements and transactions, so that he can give the right advice and instructions to the parties who promise. Because the scribe was also responsible and became a witness between the parties who promised, should there be a dispute at a later date. Clerks in today's modern era are manifested in the form of a notary\/registrar of deed of sale and purchase and accounts payable. In the composition of this verse, it is prioritized to mention the characteristic of \"fair\" rather than the characteristic of \"knowledgeable\", because the nature of fairness is more important for a scribe. Many people are knowledgeable, but they are not fair, because it is doubtful the truth of the instructions and advice they give. A just person, even if his knowledge is lacking, can be expected from him for advice and guidance that is true and impartial. The scribe's job is to write down the terms agreed upon by the parties who promised. The trick is that the debtor dictates to the clerk about something he has borrowed, the method and implementation of the agreement and so on. The purpose of dictating the contents of the agreement by the party who promised, is so that what is written is an acknowledgment from the party who owes, because with writing solely without any words made by the party who owes, then what is written alone cannot be used as an acknowledgment. Allah warns the person who promises that he always keeps his promise properly. Let him fear Allah, and commitment to the promises that have been made. Give thanks to Allah who has softened the hearts of those who have helped him in trouble. If he is grateful, Allah will always protect, care for and guide him to the easy path and the path of happiness. If the person making the promise is a person who is weak in mind or he himself is unable to dictate, then the right to dictate is transferred to the guardian concerned. Let the guardian be a fair person and know about the laws related to muamalah. Trustees should be careful in carrying out the guardianship duties. What is meant by \"a person who is weak in mind\" is a person who has not been able to maintain and use his wealth. People who are unable to dictate are like mute people, people who stutter and so on. 2. Witnesses \"Witnesses\" are people who see and know the occurrence of an event. Testimony is one of the means of evidence (bayyinah) which can be used as a basis for resolving a dispute or case. According to this verse, testimony in muamalah is carried out by at least two men, or if there are not two men, it can be done by one man and two women. Regarding the \"male\" requirements for those who will be witnesses are as follows: a. The witness must be a Muslim. This opinion is based on the words of min rijalikum (from the male among you) contained in the verse. From these words it is understood that the witness should be a Muslim. According to some scholars: being Muslim is not a requirement for a witness in muamalah. Because the purpose of testimony in muamalah is so that there is evidence, if there is a dispute or case between the parties involved at a later date. Therefore, people who are not Muslim are allowed to be witnesses as long as the purpose of holding a witness can be achieved. b. The witness should be a just, impartial person so that the purpose of holding the testimony is achieved, according to the word of Allah: ¦ and testify with two witnesses who are just among you ... (ath-thalaq\/65: 2) Furthermore, this verse distinguishes male testimony with female testimony. One male witness can be replaced by two female witnesses. Scholars differ on why Allah differentiated the number of male witnesses from the number of female witnesses. The reason that is in accordance with common sense is that men and women are each created by Allah to have advantages and disadvantages. Each has the ability and ability in a matter greater than the ability of the other party. In the field of muamalah, men have more abilities than women. In general, muamalah is mostly men who do it. Because women's attention is somewhat less than that of men in the field of muamalah, their thinking and memory in this field are also somewhat lacking. If the testimony is carried out by a woman, she may forget, therefore another woman should be present as a witness who can remind her. According to Syekh Ali Ahmad al-Jurjani: men use their minds more in considering a problem they face, while women use their feelings more. Because of this, women are weaker in their temperament, use their minds less in complex matters, especially when they are in a state of hatred and anger, they will be happy or sad over a small thing. It's different with men, he can be steadfast and patient to endure hardships, he doesn't decide a matter, except after thinking it over carefully. ) The field of muamalah is a field that uses more thoughts than feelings. A witness in muamalah also functions as a peacemaker between parties who promise if there is a dispute at a later date. Based on the testimony of Syekh Ali Ahmad al-Jurjani and other statements, it is suspected that this is one of the wisdoms why Allah equates a male witness with two female witnesses. According to Imam ash-Shafi'i: Acceptance of the testimony of a witness should be by oath. He reasoned with the sunnah of the Prophet who ordered witnesses to take an oath before giving their testimony. Meanwhile, according to Abu Hanifah: acceptance of one's testimony does not need to be accompanied by an oath. In this verse it is stated \"let the witnesses not be reluctant (to give information) when they are summoned.\" The point is: 1. Let someone be willing to be a witness in an event or incident, if the testimony is needed. 2. Let someone be willing to be a witness if something happens, while he is someone who knows about the incident. 3. Let someone be willing to be a witness to an event that happened, if no one else will be a witness. It was narrated by ar-Rabi' that this verse was revealed when a man was looking for witnesses among the crowd to ask for their testimony, but no one was available. According to one opinion, what is meant by \"let them not be reluctant\" is: let them not be reluctant to accept requests to be witnesses and carry them out. Refusing to do both is unlawful. The law of giving testimony is fardu kifayah. Then Allah explains His commandments, so that those who believe are not lazy and do not get tired of writing down the agreement that will be made, both small and large, and explained the conditions and time. In this verse Allah gives priority to mentioning \"the small\" rather than \"the big one\", because most people always look lightly and easily at agreements related to trivial (small) matters. People who underestimate agreements related to trivial (small) matters will certainly underestimate agreements related to primary (big) matters. From this verse it can also be understood that Allah warns people to be careful in matters of rights and obligations, even if those rights and obligations are related to secondary\/trivial matters. Allah mentions the wisdom of the commands and prohibitions found at the beginning of this verse, namely to uphold justice, uphold testimony, to generate confidence and eliminate doubts. If trading is done in cash, it is not a sin not to write it down. From this verse it is understood that even though it is not a sin not to write down trades in cash, it is still best to always write them down. Even though it is not obligatory to write down cash trades, God commands to bring witnesses. The command here is not obligatory, it only gives the meaning of circumcision. The goal is that humans are always careful in muamalah. Furthermore, Allah warns that scribes, witnesses and people who make agreements make it easier for the other parties, not to make it difficult and neither does one party act which results in the loss of the other party. Because the implementation of the agreement well if each party has good intentions towards the other party. And do not forget the good among you ¦ (al-Baqarah \/ 2: 237) If someone makes it difficult or harms others, then such an act is the act of a wicked person, and disobeys the provisions of Allah. At the end of this verse, Allah orders people to fear Him by taking care of themselves so that they always carry out His commands and stay away from His prohibitions. He teaches people everything that is useful for him, namely how to maintain wealth and how to use it, so as to create peace for himself and those who help him in his efforts to find and use these treasures. God knows everything that humans do, and He will reward them accordingly."

			"tafsir": "This verse explains about muamalah (transactions) that are not carried out in cash, which are carried out in transit and there is no scribe who will write them down. In the case of non-cash muamalah, which is carried out on a trip and there is no clerk to write it down, then there should be collateral (collateral) handed over to the party who owes it. Unless each trusts the other and submits himself to Allah, then muamalah can be done without submitting collateral. This verse does not stipulate that the guarantee can only be made on the condition that it is in transit, muamalah not in cash, and there is no clerk. However, this verse only states that in such circumstances muamalah may be carried out using collateral. In other situations, it is also permissible to use a guarantee in accordance with the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari that the Prophet Muhammad once mortgaged his armor to the Jews in Medina. In the last verse, Allah warned that humans should not be reluctant to become scribes or give testimony when asked. Then in this verse Allah reaffirms not to hide the testimony. Such an affirmation implies that writing and testimony help humans in guarding their wealth, and do not be negligent in doing both. Likewise, the owner of the property is not troubled because he lends his property, and is not paid on time. With the above statement it does not mean that all muamalah agreements must be written by scribes and witnessed by witnesses, but it means that Muslims always pay attention and scrutinize the muamalah that will be carried out. If muamalah is muamalah that is usually done every day, such as buying and selling that is carried out in the market and does not cause unwanted consequences in the future and is based on mutual trust, then such muamalah does not need to be written down and witnessed. On the other hand, if the muamalah is suspected to cause undesirable things in the future, then the muamalah must be written down and witnessed by two witnesses."

			"tafsir": "From this verse one can understand the perfection of the oneness of Allah in terms of: 1. One in His power. 2. One in knowing everything that happens in nature. Allah is the One in possessing all creatures. It is Allah alone who creates, grows, develops and owns this whole nature, there is nothing that is in partnership with Him. Allah is the One who knows everything in this world. God knows the great and the small, visible and invisible to humans. Everything that happens that exists in this world cannot be separated from Allah's knowledge, and nothing escapes His knowledge. Allah is One in His power. What happens in nature is by Allah's will, nothing can change His will. If He wills something to exist, it must come true. If, on the other hand, He wants something to disappear, it will disappear. Only He can know the deeds of His servants, and forgive or punish them, and a just decision is only in His hands. There are two kinds of things in the human heart. First: Something that is in the heart, that comes by itself, is moved without anyone moving it, comes to the heart by itself. Such movement is not based on human will (will) and ikhtiyar (choice), it just arises in his heart. Things like this are not punished and brought to account by Allah SWT, unless they are followed by intention, intention and endeavor. Second: Something that is in the heart that arises with effort, thought, result of reflection and so on. Movement like this turns into ideals and strong desires, so that the desire, intention and endeavor to carry it out arise. This kind of impulse is what is counted and used as the basis for determining the reward for human work. Therefore God commands that humans always watch, research and feel what is in their hearts. If what is in his heart is in accordance with Allah's commands and does not contradict His prohibitions, then take care of it and live a fertile life, so that he can manifest good deeds. Conversely, if what is in the heart is contrary to God's commandments or encourages someone to do His prohibitions, delete it immediately and get rid of it, so that he does not commit sinful acts. Humans should be aware of the possibility of bad intentions or feelings in the heart, which can lead to sin. An example is: jealousy, at first it grows out of displeasure with someone. The feeling was heightened when seeing that person's success, this success gave birth to displeasure. Then comes anger, revenge, want to take revenge and so on. If that's the feeling, it's hard to get rid of it right away. It is even feared that it can give birth to sin. But if that feeling is extinguished when it starts to grow, then that feeling of envy will not arise, and even if it does, it can be eliminated easily."

			"tafsir": "Narrated by Ahmad and Muslim from Abu Hurairah, he said, \"When Allah revealed verse 284 to the Messenger of Allah, the companions felt the burden was getting heavier, then they came to the Messenger of Allah and said, \"We have been burdened with jobs that we can do , namely prayer, fasting, jihad, almsgiving, and now this verse has also been revealed, which we are not able to carry out.\" lawless\". Say, \"We hear and we obey, we ask Your forgiveness O our Lord, and to You alone we return. When the Messenger of Allah recited this verse to them, their tongues followed him. Then the next verse came down, verse 285 al-Baqarah. Abu Hurairah said, \"When the Companions had done this, Allah removed their worries about that verse and He revealed the next verse: Allah does not burden a person except according to his ability. (al-Baqarah\/2: 286) The above hadith describes the worries of the friends who are very afraid of Allah's punishment. The Companions used to be people who lived, were educated and raised in an ignorant Arab world. Ignorance thoughts, hearts, beliefs and customs have been very influential in them. Even among them there are leaders and leaders of ignorant Arabs. After the Prophet Muhammad was sent, they followed the Prophet's call and converted to Islam wholeheartedly. However, traces of the influence of the ignorant Arab beliefs and culture are still present in their souls. These beliefs and cultures are lost and erased gradually, every time the verses of the Al-Qur'an come down and every time the treatise that is brought to them is explained. They themselves always try to get rid of the traces of bad influence from them. When this verse was revealed, they felt worried that Allah would not forgive their sins, as a result of the traces of ignorance and Arab culture that still remained in their hearts and souls, even though they had tried their best to get rid of them. Because of anxiety and worry that they immediately asked the Prophet. The feeling of worry about Allah's punishment was reflected in 'Umar bin al-Khatthab's question to Huzaifah. He once asked Huzaifah, \"Do you (Huzaifah) find in me any of the signs of hypocrisy?\" . With the revelation of this verse, the hearts of the friends feel calm and serene, because they are sure that all the prohibitions and commands of Allah are in accordance with the limits of human ability. There are no orders and prohibitions that humans cannot do or stop. Only those who disbelieve in Allah find it hard to stop His prohibition. They are also sure that the bad work that comes to their mind and they hate it, they have tried to eliminate it, because of that they will not be punished. Allah says: Allah will not punish you because of your unintentional oaths, but He will punish you because of the intentions contained in your heart. Allah is Forgiving, Most Forbearing. (al-Baqarah\/2: 225) Furthermore, Allah explains that He calculates (takes into account) what is in the human heart, whether hidden or revealed, and with His calculations, He repays human actions fairly, because the calculation and revenge is based on the nature of Allah, the Most Merciful to His servants. Then Allah confirms that with His bounty He forgives His servants and punishes them fairly and gives double rewards to those who do good deeds. Finally Allah declared that \"He is Omnipotent over all things\". From this verse it is understood that Allah is Almighty over all things, so ask Him for help, in order to carry out His commands and stop His prohibitions, ask for His taufik and guidance. The beginning of the surah Al-Baqarah begins by explaining that the Qur'an has no doubts about it and also explains the attitude of humans towards it, that is, there are those who believe, there are those who disbelieve, and there are those who are hypocrites. Furthermore, it mentions the laws of prayer, zakat, fasting, pilgrimage, marriage, jihad, usury, the law of agreements and so on. This verse is the concluding verse of surah Al-Baqarah which emphasizes the nature of the Prophet Muhammad and his followers towards the Qur'an. They believe it to be a life guide to achieve happiness in this world and in the hereafter. This verse also confirms the greatness and truth of the Prophet Muhammad, and those who believe, and confirms that these laws are true laws. With this verse Allah swt declares and stipulates that the Messenger of Allah and those who believe, truly believe in the Qur'an, they do not have the slightest doubt and they believe in the truth of the Qur'an. This statement of Allah can be seen in the Messenger of Allah and individual believers, seen in the purity and cleanliness of their hearts, the height of their aspirations, their resilience and steadfastness in accepting trials in conveying Allah's religion, their attitude when achieving victory and facing defeat , their attitude towards the enemies who have been mastered, their attitude when they were captured and their attitude when they entered the areas outside the Arabian Peninsula. Such an attitude and character is the attitude and character that is engendered by the teachings of the Qur'an, and the obedience to carry out God's law. This is what is meant by the answer of 'Aisyah ra when asked about the morals of the Prophet Muhammad, he replied: \"Didn't you always read the Qur'an? The answer was, \"Yes\". Qur'an.\" (Muslim History) If the Prophet Muhammad had not truly believed in the teachings he brought, and had not adhered to the truth in carrying out his duties, surely he and his followers would not have such a character. He would have hesitated in carrying out his ideals. His dream was to be hesitant to tell about the events of the ancient people mentioned in the Qur'an, especially in dealing with the reactions of Jews and Christians, especially considering that Jews and Christians were people who had a lot of knowledge about ancient history at that time. , because of that the Prophet Muhammad always thought about and still believed in the truth of every religious teaching that he would present to them.People who lived in the time of the Prophet, both his followers as well as those who deny it, all say that Muhammad was a man who can be trusted, not a liar. Every person who believes believes in the existence of God Almighty. Only He created creatures, not associated with anything. They believe in God's books that have been revealed to His prophets, believe in God's angels, and angels who are the link between God and His messengers, carriers of God's revelations. Regarding the state of matter, the characteristics and works of angels, it is included in Allah's knowledge, only Allah is Omniscient. Believing in angels is proof of believing in God. It was also stated that the position of the Muslims towards the apostles did not discriminate between Allah's messengers; they believed that all the apostles were the same in their faith. Allah swt said: Say, \"We believe in Allah and in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we submit ourselves to Him.\" (al-Baqarah\/2: 136) In another verse it is explained that each of the apostles has priority over the other apostles. A priority that belongs to an apostle may not be owned by another apostle, and the other apostle has a priority too. We have preferred some of them over others… (al-Baqarah\/2: 253) This verse indicates the primacy of the Muslim community over other people that distinguishes Allah's messengers. Some they believe in and some they don't. Even some of the apostles during their lifetime they made fun of. While Muslims do not treat them like that. Allah explains again other characteristics possessed by Muslims. That is, when they hear a command or prohibition from Allah, they listen with full attention, carry out the order, and stay away from His prohibition. They feel the greatness and power of Allah, and believe that only Allah must be worshiped and obeyed. Because believers have these qualities, they always pray to Allah, namely: \"Forgive us, O our Lord, and to You we will return.\" In fact, the prayer of a believer is not just to ask Allah for forgiveness for the mistakes they have made, but also to ask Allah's presence to always be given taufik and guidance, so that they can carry out all His commands and leave all His prohibitions. From this prayer it can be understood that people who believe always try to carry out Allah's commands and leave His prohibitions after they have heard, understood those orders and prohibitions. They realize that they are imperfect human beings, not without flaws. Even though their hearts and souls have promised to obey Allah's commands and prohibitions after hearing and understanding them, without realizing it they often forget and are negligent, so they ignore these orders and prohibitions. Even though they already know that Allah will not punish humans for being forgetful and negligent, those who believe believe it is their duty to ask Allah for forgiveness and repent, so that Allah will not punish them for such actions. The influence of such faith can be seen in their behavior, character, actions and deeds. Everything is pointed and directed to the path that pleases Allah. This is understood from their statement, \"To You alone we return\". This statement reveals the true nature of human life, outlining life guidelines and ultimate goals that must be achieved by humans. (286) In achieving this goal in life, humans are given a burden by Allah according to their ability, they are rewarded more than what they have worked for and receive punishment in proportion to the crimes they have committed. Charity that is charged to a person is only according to his ability. Islam is a religion that does not burden humans with heavy and difficult burdens. Easy, light and not cramped are the basic principles of Islam. Allah says: ¦. and He has not made it difficult for you in religion. ¦ (al-Â¦ajj\/22: 78). Allah wants to give you relief, because humans are created (are) weak. (an-Nisa'\/4: 28). ¦. Allah wants ease for you, and does not want hardship for you. ¦. (al-Baqarah\/2: 185) Then Allah explains the results of the practices that have been charged and carried out by humans, namely the good deeds that they have done. Then the reward will be received and felt by them in the form of reward and heaven. On the other hand, the sinful acts committed by humans, the punishment for carrying out those sinful acts, will also be felt and borne by them, namely the torment and punishment in hell. This verse encourages people to do good deeds and fulfill the obligations set by religion. This verse gives the understanding that good deeds are actions that are easy for humans to do because they are in accordance with their character and character, while bad deeds are actions that are difficult for humans to do because they are not in accordance with their character and character. Humans are born in a state of pure nature and have instilled in their hearts the soul of monotheism. Even though humans are given the potential by Allah to be good and to be bad, but with the existence of a monotheistic spirit that has been instilled in his heart since he was still in his mother's womb, the character of wanting to do good is more real in the human heart than the character of wanting to do evil. The desire that is embedded in a person to do a good job will make it possible for him to find an easy way to do that job. Especially if he is successful and can enjoy his business, then the drive and enthusiasm to do other good works will increase in him. All kinds of evil work is work that is contrary to and incompatible with human nature. They do evil deeds in the beginning is out of necessity. If he does evil deeds, then fear arises in him, always worried that others will find out. This feeling will increase every time you commit a crime. Finally, there is a feeling of laziness, a sense of sin in him and he feels that he is hated by others. Rasulullah saw said: \"Virtue is good manners, and sin is everything that is etched in your heart, while you don't like other people to know about it.\" (Muslim History) The difficulties arising from evil deeds will be felt by man more when he has begun to receive punishment, directly or indirectly for his actions. From this verse it is also understood that a person will not receive profit or loss due to the actions of other people; they will not be punished for the sins of others. They are punished only because of the crimes they have committed themselves. (That is) that a person who sins will not bear other people's sins, and that humans only get what they have worked for, (an-Najm\/53:38 and 39) On the other hand, humans can receive benefits in the form of rewards, when they die later , from the results of his efforts during his lifetime. Included in human endeavors are his pious children who pray for him, the alms he gives and the useful knowledge he teaches. The Messenger of Allah said: When a person dies, his deeds (reward) are cut off except for three things, namely: a pious child who prays for him, almsgiving, and useful knowledge. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim history from Abu Hurairah) After mentioning the characteristics of believers and mentioning the gifts that Allah has bestowed on His servants, namely not burdening servants with what they cannot do, Allah teaches prayer to always begged Him to be forgiven of all sins due to doing forbidden deeds due to forgetfulness, wrong or unintentional. The prayer that is taught to us is not just to be read and repeated the pronunciation, but the intention is that the prayer is read sincerely with all the heart and soul, in addition to carrying out all His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, according to the servant's ability. Alone. Prayer is closely related to actions and deeds. Actions and actions are also closely related to science. Therefore a person who prays cannot be said to be praying, if he does not do the things that must be done and stay away from the prohibitions that must be abandoned. Action and charity must be based on science. There are deeds that can be done and there are deeds that cannot be done, there are deeds that are done perfectly and there are also deeds that cannot be done perfectly. To perfect this deficiency, Allah teaches prayer to His servants. In other words; prayer perfects deeds that cannot be done perfectly. From the prayer it is understood that in essence a forbidden act that is done because of forgetfulness or wrong and unintentional, there is also a punishment. The punishment was imposed on the culprit. Therefore Allah taught the prayer to His servant so that he would avoid that punishment. After being taught a prayer to ask Allah for forgiveness for all the deeds he did because he forgot and accidentally, another prayer was also taught to ask him not to be burdened with the heavy burden that was imposed on the ancients. Then another prayer was taught to ask that he would not be burdened with a burden he could not bear. Among the prayers of these believers are as follows: \"O Allah, erase our sins and mistakes, both intentional and unintentional, and let us not be punished for the sins we have done. Do not torture us for it, give us taufik and guidance in all our actions, so that we can carry out Your commands with ease.\" We have been given guidelines in praying to Allah, asking for His help in dealing with unbelievers. The help being asked for here is help in order to achieve victory. What is meant by victory is victory in this world and the hereafter, not merely victory in war."

Charity that is charged to a person is only according to his ability. Islam is a religion that does not burden humans with heavy and difficult burdens. Easy, light and not cramped are the basic principles of Islam. Allah says: \"…. and He has not made it difficult for you in religion. …\" (al-hajj\/22: 78). \"God wants to give you relief, because humans are created (are) weak\". (an-Nisa?\/4: 28). \"...
