When the disbelievers saw the awesomeness that happened at that time, they bowed their heads and felt humiliated. Allah said: And (what a horror), if you saw those who sinned bowed their heads before their Lord, (they said), \"O our Lord, we have seen and heard, then return us (to the world), surely we will do good. Truly, we are people of faith.\" (as-Sajdah\/32: 12) And the word of Allah: And you will see them being brought down to hell in a downcast state because (feeling) contempt, they see with a languid look. And those who believe say, \"Indeed, the losers are those who will harm themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.\" Remember, in fact the wrongdoers are in eternal punishment.
